 anti_tank_heavy_desc:0 "Heavy Anti-tank guns are guns designed to destroy armored vehicles from defensive positions. To keep up with the mobile forces the AT-guns were motorized and got trucks to pull the guns. In order to penetrate vehicle armor they fire smaller caliber shells from longer-barreled guns to achieve higher muzzle velocity than field artillery weapons, many of which are howitzers. The higher velocity, flatter trajectory ballistics provide terminal kinetic energy to penetrate the moving/static target's armor at a given range and contact's angle. Any field artillery cannon with barrel length 15 to 25 times longer than its caliber was able also to fire anti-tank ammunition, such as the Soviet A-19.\nPrior to World War II few anti-tank guns had (or needed) calibers larger than 50 mm. Examples of guns in this class include the German 37 mm, US 37 mm (the largest gun able to be towed by the jeep), French 25 mm and 47 mm guns, British QF 2-pounder (40 mm), Italian 47 mm and Soviet 45 mm. All of these light weapons could penetrate the thin armor found on most pre-war and early war tanks."

 ##### ITA #######
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Bolzano Class"
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Bolzano class combined the high speed of the Trento class with armament and stepped hull of the Zara class. She displaced nearly 11,000 tons standard and mounted eight 203mm guns."
 ITA_battleship_1:0 "Conte Di Cavour Class"
 ITA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Conte Di Cavour class battleships were commissioned during World War I. They had 305mm Armstrong-Vickers guns, displaced 23,000 tons, and had a top speed comparable to other dreadnought-era battleships. Starting in 1933, the two remaining ships of the class underwent a serious rebuild, improving their size, armament, and performance to be on par with the emerging 'fast' battleships of the time."
 ITA_battleship_2:0 "Littorio Class"
 ITA_battleship_2_desc:0 "First laid down in 1934, the Littorio class, also known as the Vittorio Veneto class, represented a significant improvement in Italian battleship design. They displaced over 40,000 tons and were very fast for their size."
 ITA_battleship_3:0 "Roma Class"
 ITA_battleship_3_desc:0 "While technically part of the Littorio class, these ships were laid down four years after the first Littorios, and integrated a number of improvements."
 ITA_battleship_4:0 "Impero Class"
 ITA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Impero battleships were a hypothetical class of late-war battleships. They displaced about 43,000 tons, were armed with 381mm Ansaldo guns, and were well-armored."

 ##### FRA #######
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Duquesne Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duquesne-class heavy cruisers were France's first 'Treaty Cruisers', and like Italy's early cruisers compromised armour for higher speed.  They were armed with eight 203mm guns, and could make nearly 34 knots, but they had just 30mm of armour protection, limited to covering key areas."
 ##### USA #######
 USA_destroyer_2:0 "Mahan Class"
 USA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Mahan Class was the USA's first "1500 Tonner" destroyer, and had five dual-purpose 5"/38 guns, advanced machinery for its time and 12 torpedo tubes."

 GER_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The 1923 Type was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were almost as large as small destroyers, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 #GER_battleship_1:0 "Schlesien Class "
 #GER_battleship_2:0 "Bismarck Class"
 #GER_battleship_2_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 #GER_battleship_3:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 #GER_battleship_3_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16") guns."
 #GER_battleship_4:0 "M Class"
 #GER_battleship_4_desc:0 "Proposed later ships in the H Class, these vessels were never laid down nor received final specifications.  However, given the plans for the initial ships in the H Class, there's little doubt these would have been large, fast and powerful warships."
 ##### SOV #######
 SOV_destroyer_1:0 "Novik Class"
 SOV_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Novik class destroyers were the then Russia's first modern destroyers, and early in her life Novik achieved just over 37 knots, making her briefly the fastest ship in the world.  As well as speed, the Novik class had four 102mm guns and eight torpedo tubes, but she also had a relatively short range. Her design strongly influenced succeeding Russian destroyer classes, such as the Orfey, Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes."
 SOV_light_cruiser_1:0 "Krasnyi Krym Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Krasnyi Kavkaz Class"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. However, her top speed was a bit slower and her armour not as thick as many contemporary heavy cruisers."

 CHL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Almirante Lynch-class destroyers were a group of six ships ordered for the Chilean Navy in the U.K. just before World War I. Only two ships were delivered before the outbreak of war and served until 1945. They displaced 1,430 tons, had decent speed and range for their vintage, and were armed with six 4 in. L/40 QF Mark VI main guns and two 21 in. torpedo tubes."
 CHL_submarine_1_desc:0 "These submarines were a set of six British H-class, or Holland 602, submarines built in the USA originally for the UK and transferred to Chile in 1917 in return for ships the UK was building for Chile but appropriated for its own use in WWI. The ships were built in 1915, they displaced over 360 tons, had a diving depth of 30m, and were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes."
 CHI_protected_cruiser_1:0 "Hairong Class"
 CHI_protected_cruiser_desc:0 "The Hairong Class were a series of three protected cruisers built for China in the late 1890s by Germany. The ships were similar to other protected cruisers and subsequent light cruisers produced for China around the turn of the century. Hai Yung displaced just under 2,700 tons and were armed with a main armamanet of three 5.9 in QF guns and a secondary armamanet of eight 4.1 inch guns."
 CHI_destroyer_1:0 "Chien Wei Class"
 CHI_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Chien Wei Class was a class of two large torpedo gunboats built for the Nationalist Chinese navy and commissioned in 1904. The ships were modernized in 1930-31 and still in service at the time of the Japanese invasion. Once modernized, they displaced 870 tons and were armed with two 4.7 in. main guns."
 COL_destroyer_2:0 "Antioquia Class"
 COL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Antioquia class consisted of two destroyers built for the Columbian Navy in Portugal. The ships were commissioned in 1934. They displaced over 1,200 tons and were armed with four BL 4.7 in. guns and eight 533mm torpedo tubes."

 HOL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Koningin Regentes Class"
 HOL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Hertog Hendrik, the last survivor of the three Koningin Regentes Class in 1936, was a coastal defence battleship with two 9.4 inch main guns, four 5.9 inch secondary guns and an armoured belt of 6 inches at its thickest point.  While slower than a more modern heavy cruiser, it had considerably more firepower than a light cruiser of the time."
 SIA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Taksin Class"
 SIA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Taksin class consisted of a pair of light cruisers built in Italy. They were launched in 1941 but were requisitioned by the Siamese navy in 1942. They were to become the Etna-class Italian AA cruisers of the Regia Marina but were never completed before the Italian armistice. They would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armor but would be fairly slow for a cruiser."
