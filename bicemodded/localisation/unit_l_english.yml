 anti_tank_heavy_desc:0 "Heavy Anti-tank guns are guns designed to destroy armored vehicles from defensive positions. To keep up with the mobile forces the AT-guns were motorized and got trucks to pull the guns. In order to penetrate vehicle armor they fire smaller caliber shells from longer-barreled guns to achieve higher muzzle velocity than field artillery weapons, many of which are howitzers. The higher velocity, flatter trajectory ballistics provide terminal kinetic energy to penetrate the moving/static target's armor at a given range and contact's angle. Any field artillery cannon with barrel length 15 to 25 times longer than its caliber was able also to fire anti-tank ammunition, such as the Soviet A-19.\nPrior to World War II few anti-tank guns had (or needed) calibers larger than 50 mm. Examples of guns in this class include the German 37 mm, US 37 mm (the largest gun able to be towed by the jeep), French 25 mm and 47 mm guns, British QF 2-pounder (40 mm), Italian 47 mm and Soviet 45 mm. All of these light weapons could penetrate the thin armor found on most pre-war and early war tanks."

Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were almost as large as small destroyers, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."

The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 #GER_battleship_3:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 #GER_battleship_3_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16") guns."

As well as speed, the Novik class had four 102mm guns and eight torpedo tubes, but she also had a relatively short range. Her design strongly influenced succeeding Russian destroyer classes, such as the Orfey, Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes."
 SOV_light_cruiser_1:0 "Krasnyi Krym Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Krasnyi Kavkaz Class"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. However, her top speed was a bit slower and her armour not as thick as many contemporary heavy cruisers."

Only two ships were delivered before the outbreak of war and served until 1945. They displaced 1,430 tons, had decent speed and range for their vintage, and were armed with six 4 in. L/40 QF Mark VI main guns and two 21 in. torpedo tubes."
 CHL_submarine_1_desc:0 "These submarines were a set of six British H-class, or Holland 602, submarines built in the USA originally for the UK and transferred to Chile in 1917 in return for ships the UK was building for Chile but appropriated for its own use in WWI. The ships were built in 1915, they displaced over 360 tons, had a diving depth of 30m, and were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes."
 CHI_protected_cruiser_1:0 "Hairong Class"
 CHI_protected_cruiser_desc:0 "The Hairong Class were a series of three protected cruisers built for China in the late 1890s by Germany. The ships were similar to other protected cruisers and subsequent light cruisers produced for China around the turn of the century. Hai Yung displaced just under 2,700 tons and were armed with a main armamanet of three 5.9 in QF guns and a secondary armamanet of eight 4.1 inch guns."

While slower than a more modern heavy cruiser, it had considerably more firepower than a light cruiser of the time."
 NOR_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Eidsvold Class"
 NOR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Eidsvold Class were two coastal defense ships built for Norway in Britain at the turn of the century. Their armour and armament, which centered around two 210mm guns, was comparable to a heavy cruiser, although their size, which displaced just over 4,200 tons, was closer to a light cruiser."
 SIA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Taksin Class"
 SIA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Taksin class consisted of a pair of light cruisers built in Italy. They were launched in 1941 but were requisitioned by the Siamese navy in 1942. They were to become the Etna-class Italian AA cruisers of the Regia Marina but were never completed before the Italian armistice. They would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armor but would be fairly slow for a cruiser."
