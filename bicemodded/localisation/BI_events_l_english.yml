The meeting marked a turning point in Hitler's foreign policies which then began to radicalize.  It outlined Hitler's plans for expansion in Europe.\n\nAccording to the Memorandum, Hitler did not want war in 1939 with Britain and France.  What he wanted was small wars of plunder to help support Germany's struggling economy.  Although the Nazis never let on about their financial problems.  Hitler wanted a full-scale European war with Britain and France between 1941-1944/45."

 news.2242.d:0 "The Blomberg-Fritsch Affair were two related scandals in early 1938 that resulted in the subjugation of the German Armed Forces by Hitler.  The affair started after the 12 January 1938 marriage of War Minister Werner von Blomberg when a policeman reported that his young bride had previously posed for pornographic photos.  Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage in order to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army.  Blomberg refused to annul the marriage and when Goering threatened to make his wife's past public knowledge, Blomberg consequently resigned on 27 January 1938.  Goering did not want Fritsch to become the successor to Blomberg and thus his superior.  Himmler wanted to weaken the Wehrmacht in order to strengthen his Schutzstaffel as a competitor to the regular German Army.  Reinhard Heydrich had prepared a file on von Fritsch with allegations of homosexuality.  Fritsch resigned on 4 February 1938."

 news.2244.d:0 "Modern Times is a 1936 comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin in which his iconic Little Tramp character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the Great Depression, conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization.\n\nChaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first talkie, and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of the Tramp would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen."

Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion.\n\nAs rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling's jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible.\n\nBy round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis' only knockout defeat during his prime."

The divide between the two ran deep enough that even many of the companies that built aircraft were contracted exclusively to one service. In addition to carrier aircraft, the IJN developed its own land-based fighters and bombers."

 enigma.3.d:0 "ULTRA was the name used by the British for intelligence resulting from decryption of encrypted German radio communications in World War II. The term eventually became the standard designation for all intelligence from high-level cryptanalytic sources.  The name arose because the code-breaking was considered more important than the highest security classification available at the time, (Most Secret), and so was regarded as being Ultra secret.  Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, hence the term Ultra has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts".  The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is credited with having provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort and with having shortened the war, though Ultra's precise influence is still being studied and debated.  We will gain a decrypt against Germany."

The British used this information as the foundation for their own early efforts to decrypt Enigma.  The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire "shooting party" was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages. These proved too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections."

Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking messages enciphered on the German Enigma machine, but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been the breaking of the German Fish High Command teleprinter cyphers.  The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was code-named "Ultra".

Meanwhile, the Conservatives were pressuring King to advise that the Governor General introduce overseas conscription. In April 1942 a plebiscite was held on the question, "Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligations arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service?"\n\nThe plebiscite was supported by most English Canadians as well as the banned Communist Party of Canada which established Tim Buck "Yes" Committees to campaign for a yes vote. Across Canada, 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Even in Toronto, a strongly pro-conscription region, Conservative Arthur Meighen was defeated in a by-election after promising to help introduce conscription."

The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later concentration camps. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the concentration camps under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the "Death's Head Units", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major concentration camps. Leadership at the camps was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional camps.[92] Six concentration camps[a] housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939. By the end of the war, hundreds of camps of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people, most of whom were targeted by the regime because of their race. The concentration camp population rose in tandem with the defeats suffered by the Nazi regime; the worse the catastrophe seemed, the greater the fear of subversion, prompting the SS to intensify their repression and terror."

Recruits had to be between the ages of 17 and 23, at least 1.74 metres (5 ft 9 in) tall (1.78 metres (5 ft 10 in) for the Leibstandarte). Recruits were required to have perfect teeth and eyesight and provide a medical certificate. By 1938 the height restrictions were relaxed, up to six dental fillings were permitted, and eyeglasses for astigmatism and mild vision correction were allowed. Once World War II in Europe commenced, the physical requirements were no longer strictly enforced, and essentially any recruit who could pass a basic medical exam was considered for Waffen-SS service. Following the campaign in the West in 1940, Hitler authorized the enlistment of "people perceived to be of related stock", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks. A number of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns volunteered to fight in the Waffen-SS under the command of German officers. Non-Germanic units such as the Indische Tiger Legion and the Azad Hind Legion were not considered to be part of the SS directly, which still maintained its strict racial criteria, but rather were considered to be foreign nationals serving under the command of the SS."

In September 1941 the division was attached to the Finnish III Corps under General Hjalmar Siilasvuo, and took up new positions at Louhi, Kiestinki. By the end of 1941, it had suffered heavy casualties. Over the winter of 1941–42 it received replacements from the general pool of Waffen-SS recruits.

The major dislocation of the population caused by mobilisation and mass evacuation and also the wartime need for complete manpower control and planning in order to maximise the efficiency of the war economy.\n\n2. The likelihood of rationing (introduced from January 1940 onwards).\n\n3. Population statistics. As the last census had been held in 1931, there was little accurate data on which to base vital planning decisions.

 kns.2.d_f:0 "Despite numerous guerilla warfare and popular supports, the democratic supporters had been defeated in the Japanese civil war. All suspects were detained or executed. In order to stablize the situation, Emperor Hirohito gave a speech to the Japanese public stated that war is their only destiny. However, the crowd's response stated otherwise."
 kns.2.d_d:0 "After hours of assault to the emperor's bunker, the fascist regime surrendered to the democratic supporters. Having won the civil war, the democratic cabinet is now trying to mend the wounds caused by the former fascist regime. 'We do not hope to be forgiven, but we will do our part nonetheless.' said one of the Japanese democratic revolutionaries."

The Japanese Army later marched into the city with minimal resistence.\n\nThe Forbidden Palace has reported to have some artefacts removed by the Japanese. Fortunately most of it was evacuated back in 1933 to the south, so the Japanese were only able to remove a few large bronze tubs and a few pieces of cannon."

The troublesome aspect is that not only did Quebéc vote no, they voted nearly 73% against it. It is very likely that things will not change in Quebec in terms of conscription. Perhaps in light of what their peers have said they will change their minds, even if just a little. Of course we could be more forceful instead."

As a result the garrisons were allowed to leave safely and forthright Newfoundland and Labrador belong to us."
 better_canada.5.a:0 "Just as planned"
 better_canada.6.d:0 "Earlier this morning locals of Newfoundland and Labrador were incited to a mob and marched onto the various garrison bases demanding their independence from [ENG.GetName]. The officers, fearing a senseless bloodshed, gave in to their demands and the [ENG.GetNameDef] troops were allowed to leave peacefully. There are already whispers that this was far too coordinated to have simply have been a 'random' set of mobs and accusations have been already levied towards [CAN.GetName] as being the likely culprit."

There it was decided to unite all of the parties into one new party led by a particularily charismatic person called 'Adrien Arcand'.

The Act also prohibited organising, training or equipping an association of persons for the purpose of enabling them to be employed in usurping the functions of the police or of the armed forces of the Crown, or for the use or display of physical force in promoting any political object.\n\nThe Act had the indirect result of actually improving the stance of the BUF.  Their forced abandonment of paramilitary and armed tactics improved the party's relations with the police, and in making it more respectable increased the BUF appeal among traditionally conservative middle-class citizens who became the party's main base in the years after the Public Order Act 1936 was passed."

startevent.2.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Overview"
startevent.2.d:0 "Japan is one of the major Axis-aligned nations in the game. Generally, we can say Japan faces significant resource limitations, especially for oil and rubber. These can be mitigated through aggressive expansion, either north into the USSR or south into China and Southeast Asia. Japan has an impressively-sized navy but has relatively weak naval production capacity. The army is mostly infantry-based and Japan will struggle to keep up with Western armor technology. More information is available to read in each tab."

startevent.3.t:0 "Empire of Japan - History"
startevent.3.d:0 "Imperial Japan's rapid industrialization and militarization led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire. Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism, eventually culminating in Japan's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific region. In 1931, Japan invaded and conquered the Northeast China / Manchuria, with little resistance. Japan invaded China proper in 1937, creating what was essentially a three-way war between Japan, Mao Zedong's communists, and Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists.\n In late 1941, Japan's government, led by Prime Minister and General Hideki Tojo, decided to break the US-led embargo through force of arms. In the early stages of the war, Japan scored victory after victory. The tide began to turn against Japan following the Battle of Midway in June 1942 and the subsequent Battle of Guadalcanal, in which Allied troops wrested the Solomon Islands from Japanese control. on August 6, 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb over Hiroshima, killing over 90,000 people. The unconditional surrender of Japan was announced by Emperor Hirohito on August 14."
startevent.4.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Army"
startevent.4.b:0 "Tell me more about the technologies"
startevent.4.d:0 "Imperial Japan has a relatively small number of operational divisions at game start. Infantry divisions are mostly overstrength; 15 divisions are in either a 3x5 or 4x5 pattern, meaning the divisions are around twice as large as comparable 3x3 regimented divisions. Making these divisions smaller may prove useful in the dispersed, low-infrastructure areas Japan will likely be invading. Japan's 3 mixed infantry divisions and 9 cavalry divisions can serve as a basis for either a light secondary infantry force, or can be motorized / mechanized later on. Japan has 2 motorized divisions which are quite developed. Japan's armor is lacking, with only 2 small brigade-sized groupings, and will require substantial investment to improve. Japan also has 30 garrison divisions, mostly stationed in the Pacific islands. These can be either disbanded or retooled to defend other areas, depending on your priorities."
startevent.5.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Navy"
startevent.5.d:0 "Imperial Japan starts with one of the most impressive navies in the game, only outclassed by the USA and UK. Japan starts with 2 relatively modern aircraft carriers and 2 light aircraft carriers, which form a healthy baseline from which to build a larger, dispersed carrier fleet. Japan has 6 battleships and 4 battlecruisers completed at start, which are all fairly modern. Japan also has considerable numbers of medium-sized ships: 17 heavy cruisers and 19 light cruisers of varying age. Japan has 92 screening ships at game start, which are similarly split between modern and interwar. The submarine fleet of 52 is large but somewhat out of date. Japan's initial production queue has 2 carriers, 4 heavy cruisers, 13 destroyers, and 7 submarines. The player can choose whether to prioritize capital ships over a raiding fleet, or if Japan should focus more resources on battleships as opposed to fleet carriers. Ultimately, Japan's biggest naval weakness is its difficulty rebuilding its fleet due to its output to fleet size ratio."
startevent.6.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Airforce"
startevent.6.d:0 "Japan's airforce is quite unique. The IJA and IJN both competed for power and influence in the Japanese state, and operated almost totally independently in many cases. This can be seen in their air developments - both branches had separate planes which they used. Most of the IJN airforce in 1936 was located in Taiwan, with about around 900 planes, most of which are naval bombers, short-range fighters and close air support. The IJA airforce was split between Manchuria and the Home Islands, with about 850 aircraft, again mostly short-range fighters and close air support, with some medium bombers. While Japan does have good short-range planes, it will need a significant investment of research in order to develop longer-range bombers or fighters - and if you are playing historical, you will need to double this, as both military branches will require separate technology investment."
startevent.7.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Strategy"
startevent.7.d:0 "Japan's lack of material resources and existing military adventures in East Asia will make your first priority the subjugation of China, which has tremendous manpower and good amounts of natural resources to exploit. After this, Japan is presented with two equally difficult options: to either strike north into the USSR using land forces, or to strike south using naval forces. Japan's productive capacity will limit its ability to do both simultaneously and so only one should be considered. Going north will require building up Manchurian infrastructure and Japan's lacking armored forces, while going south will require additional naval invasion forces and using natural resources for the Imperial Japanese Navy."

 worldnews.5.t:0 "The Paris universal exhibition" 
 worldnews.5.d:0 "The France is proud to launch with great fanfare the universal exhibition of 1937. In Paris, about 101 hectares, 44 countries offer hundred-four-twenty-ten pavilions around the theme of arts and techniques applied to modern life. Nearly 32 million visitors will rush to come. At the time, Paris will retain the Chaillot Palace, the Palace of discovery, and the Palais de Tokyo. The spirit and the new art triumph everywhere. The world wants to believe for a moment that the exhibition will finally bring together everything that unites men. But strikes the spirits is both monumental Soviet and German pavilions facing to challenge each other: one with a statue of twenty-five metres of Worker and Kolkhoz Woman brandishing a sickle and a hammer; the other by a monumental sculpture of an eagle holding a swastika in its talons."
