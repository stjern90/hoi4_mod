 desenvolvimentismo:0   "Developmentalism"
 desenvolvimentismo_desc:0 "Developmentalism is the idea that the state must be the base of industrial growth. By 1936 Brazil faced heavy economical crisis; its economy, based of non-manufactured exports, is failing due to low commodity prices. More than that, the global economic crisis and growing world tension lead to a shortage of industrialized imports. Our people are unemployed and the rich can't spend their money. This catastrophe leaves no choice to the state and its people, other than full industrialization of the country."
 desco:0 "Industrialization Effort"
 desco_desc:0 "As imports and exports kept going down the Brazilian government interfered directly into the economy, ending decades of liberalism. The first action was to stabilize the price of coffee, the main Brazilian export, by burning all produced surplus to reduce price. The second action was the creation of many state factories and companies to create jobs and reduce unemployment. The third action was a new industrial expansion, which was meant to manufacture Brazilian goods for exports, and to supply the internal market that was dependent on imports. The fourth action was to strenghen Brazilian military industry, in view of the growing world tension."

 politica_desc:0 "Politics is the process of making uniform decisions applying to all members of a group. It also involves the use of power by one person to affect the behavior of another person. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. A variety of methods are employed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level. It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Politics and the works of Confucius. Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures.  Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives."

 repub_desc:0 "A republic is a sovereign state or country  which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body  and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic is commonly limited to a government which excludes a monarch.  Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word "republic" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word "republic" in their names."
 mona_i:0 "Support the Monarchy"
 mona_i_desc:0 "A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolical (crowned republic) to partial and restricted (constitutional monarchy) to completely despotic (absolute monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are eligible, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy."
 mona_ii:0 "Restore the Empire"
 mona_ii_desc:0 "The Empire of Brazil was a 19th-century state that broadly comprised the territories which form modern Brazil and Uruguay. Its government was a representative parliamentary constitutional monarchy under the rule of Emperors Dom Pedro I and his son Dom Pedro II. A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808, when the Portuguese Prince regent, later King Dom João VI, fled from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. João VI later returned to Portugal, leaving his eldest son and heir, Pedro, to rule the Kingdom of Brazil as regent. On 7 September 1822, Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and, after waging a successful war against his father's kingdom, was acclaimed on 12 October as Pedro I, the first Emperor of Brazil. The new country was huge but sparsely populated and ethnically diverse. Unlike most of the neighboring Hispanic American republics, Brazil had political stability, vibrant economic growth, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech, and respect for civil rights of its subjects, albeit with legal restrictions on women and slaves, the latter regarded as property and not citizens. The empire's bicameral parliament was elected under comparatively democratic methods for the era, as were the provincial and local legislatures. This led to a long ideological conflict between Pedro I and a sizable parliamentary faction over the role of the monarch in the government. He faced other obstacles. The unsuccessful Cisplatine War against the neighboring United Provinces of the Río de la Plata in 1828 led to the secession of the province of Cisplatina (later to become Uruguay). In 1826, despite his role in Brazilian independence, he became the king of Portugal; he immediately abdicated in favor of his eldest daughter. Two years later, her throne was usurped by Pedro I's younger brother. Unable to deal with both Brazilian and Portuguese affairs, Pedro I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and immediately departed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.(You are a constitutional monarchy, the Head of State will be the Emperor but Prime Ministers will be elected in the background every 4 years)"

The Brazilian military was first formed by Emperor Dom Pedro I to defend the new nation against the Portuguese in the Brazilian War of Independence. The Army and Armada (as the Navy was called) were commissioned in 1822 with the objective of defeating and expelling the Portuguese troops from Brazilian soil. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the Empire of Brazil. A sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious Paraguayan War. The Emperor was commander-in-chief of the military, with the Ministries of War and Navy as the main organs by which military policy was carried out. THE EMPIRE NEEDS MORE THAN A FEW GOOD MEN"

In the last cabinet of the monarchic regime, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral José da Costa Azevedo (the Baron of Ladário), left the reorganization and modernization of the navy unfinished. The coup that ended the monarchy in Brazil in 1889 was not well accepted by the personnel of the Armada. Imperial Mariners were attacked when they tried to support the imprisoned Emperor in the City Palace. The Marquis of Tamandaré begged Pedro II to allow him to fight back the coup; however, the Emperor refused to allow any bloodshed. Tamandaré would later be imprisoned by order of the dictator Floriano Peixoto under the accusation of financing the monarchist military in the Federalist Revolution. The Baron of Ladário remained in contact with the exiled Imperial Family, hoping to restore the monarchy, but ended up ostracized by the republican government. Admiral Saldanha da Gama led the Revolt of the Armada with the objective of restoring the Empire and allied himself with other monarchists who were fighting in the Federalist Revolution. However, all the attempts at restoration were violently crushed. High ranking Monarchist officers were imprisoned, banished or executed by firing squad without due process of law and their subordinates also suffered harsh punishments.

 fria_indu_ii_desc:0 "Early in the 1950s, however, convinced that the only hope for rapid growth was to change the structure of the Brazilian economy, the government adopted an explicit policy of import substitution industrialization. An important instrument of this policy was the use of foreign exchange controls to protect selected segments of domestic industry and to facilitate the importation of equipment and inputs for them. However, the move to fixed exchange rates together with import licensing drastically curtailed exports, and the balance of payments problem became acute. The system became nearly unmanageable, and in 1953 a more flexible, multiple-exchange-rate system was introduced. Under the latter, imports considered essential were brought in at a favored rate; imports of goods that could be supplied domestically faced high rates and were allotted small portions of the available foreign exchange. Similarly, some exports were stimulated with a higher exchange rate than those of traditional exports. This system continued to be the main instrument for the promotion of import substitution industrialization, but the performance of the export sector improved only modestly."

Rather than accuse me, they insult me; they do not fight me, they vilify me and do not allow me the right to defend myself. They must drown my voice and impede my actions so that I shall not continue to defend the people as I always have, especially the humble. I follow my destiny. After decades of domination and plunder by international economic and financial groups, I placed myself at the head of a revolution and won. I began the work of liberation and I restored a regime of social freedom. I had to resign. I returned to the Government on the shoulders of the people. The underground campaign of international groups allied with rebellious national groups that opposed the program of guaranteed employment. The extraordinary profits law was held up in Congress. Hatred was unleashed against the just revision of the minimum wage. The potentialization of our resources through Petrobrás would create national freedom; this had hardly begun to operate when the wave of agitation swelled. Eletrobrás was obstructed to the point of desperation. They do not want the worker to be free. They do not want the people to be independent. I assumed the Government in the midst of an inflationary spiral which was destroying the value of work. Profits for foreign companies were reaching as much as 500 percent per year. In declaration of import values, evidence showed frauds of more than $100 million per year. With the coffee crisis, our main product increased in value. We tried to defend the price, and the response was violent pressure on our economy until we were obliged to yield. I have fought month by month, day by day, hour by hour, in resistance to constant, incessant pressure, bearing everything in silence, forgetting everything, yielding myself in order to defend the people who, if I fail, are abandoned. There is nothing more I can give you except my blood. If the birds of prey want someone's blood, if they want to go on draining the Brazilian people, I offer my life as the holocaust. I choose this way to be always with you. When they humiliate you, you will feel my soul suffering by your side. When hunger knocks at your door, you will feel in your breast the energy to fight for yourselves and for your children. When you are slandered, my memory will give you the strength to respond. My sacrifice will keep you united and my name will be your fighting flag. Each drop of my blood will be an immortal flame in your conscience and will maintain the sacred will to resist. To hatred I reply with pardon. And to those who think they have defeated me, I reply with my victory. I was a slave to the people, and today I free myself for eternal life. But this people, to whom I was slave, will no longer be slave to anyone. My sacrifice will be  forever in its soul and my blood will be the price of its ransom. I fought against the exploitation ofBrazil. I fought against the exploitation of the people. I have fought with my whole heart. Hatred, infamy and slander have not conquered my spirit. I gave my life to you. Now I offer you my death. I fear nothing. Calmly I take the first step toward eternity and leave life to enter History." - Getulio Vargas"
