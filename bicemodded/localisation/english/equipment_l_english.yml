The turret was the same as in the T-26 m 1933 and BT-5 tanks, and also equipped with the 45mm 20K main gun. The biggest limitation of the BA-6 was the mobility, limited to roads or very hard ground, the result of unnecessarily large weight. The innovation that slightly improved mobility were the auxiliary tracks that could be fitted onto the rear tandem wheels, converting the car to half-track. The important improvements of the BA-6 were the new GK tires, filled with much less vulnerable sponge rubber. On the downside, the tires reduced both the speed and range. All cars of this series were very heavily armed for the era; they could knock out other vehicles with ease, including tanks. However, their thin armor of 9mm at the front and 15mm at the turret made them vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire and small caliber cannon fire."

The basic BA-10 design was developed from the BA-3/6 heavy armored cars and carried the same turret and 45mm 20K gun at a weight of around 5,2 tons. It had an improved GAZ-AAA chassis and improved armor (up to 15mm at front / turret). The BA-10 used a slightly smaller, better-sloped armor layout than that of the BA-6, thus improving protection while saving weight. The greater engine power (50 hp, compared to 40 hp on the BA-6) made the vehicle more reliable and allowed a top road speed of 53km/h. Like its predecessors, the BA-10 could be converted to a half-track by fitting auxiliary tracks to the rear pair of dual tandem wheels. The tracks were often fitted when the vehicle needed to move across snow or soft ground."

At 2,2 tons of weight, cheap and exceptionally reliable, it would later become the most common Soviet wheeled armoured fighting vehicle with over 9,000 being manufactured before production ended. The BA-64 represented an important watershed in Soviet armoured car technology, as its multi-faceted hull ( with frontal armour of 15mm) gave its crew superior protection from small arms fire and shell fragments compared to the BA-20. BA-64s also possessed a much higher power-to-weight ratio and the placement of their wheels at the extreme corners of the chassis resulted in exceptional manoeuvrability. The BA-64 was initially armed with a single 7.62mm Degtyaryov machine gun in an open-topped turret.The machine gun was mounted on a fixed mount that allowed it to be elevated sufficiently to engage low-flying aircraft."

From July 1942 they were built on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. Later a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. It had all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear. The turret in the 231/232 series was a hexagonal shape and equipped with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun."

 GER_motorized_AC_equipment_099_desc:0 "This new armored car was seen as a successor to the eight-wheeled (8×8) Panzerspähwagen Sdkfz.231. Among other priorities, better protection with 30mm front armour and heavier armament in different versions ( ranging from 20mm to 50mm KwK39 (Puma) and short and long barreled 75mm KwK´s) were viewed as crucial for the new armored car. It had a Tatra 103 V12 diesel engine with 210 hp allowing a top road speed of 90 km/h."

The turret carried a "Quick Firing" (shell and cartridge in one complete round) 3-pounder gun (47mm L/32) and four Hotchkiss machine guns. A novel, unique feature was a three-man turret. no other manufacturer constructed a tank with a three-man turret until the German Panzer III. The crew of five was only poorly protected by 6.25 mm plating, rivetted to the chassis, barely enough to counter the threat posed by light machine guns.

Power came in the form of a Meadows 6-cylinder gasoline engine, producing 88 HP, coupled with a four speed preselector gearbox. The traverse of the turret was electrically actuated and housed a single MG. The Mk.III and Mk.IV differed very little, the idler wheel on the Mk.IV was removed, with the bogie wheels being respaced."

The increase in the crew size made a lot of difference to the tank's effectiveness and spread the maintenance load. The armament of the Mark V was an improvement over the earlier Marks; a 0.5 inch (12,7mm) Vickers machine gun was added to the existing 0.303 ( 7,7mm). This gave the tank a reasonable anti-tank capability against other contemporary light tanks―at the time most european light tanks had around 12–14 millimetres  of armour―but it was not updated as more armoured light tanks came into use.

The 7.6 ton Tetrarchs can be transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders. It had a unusual steering and mechanical system which accomplished turns by the lateral movement of road wheels, which bowed the tracks. When the driver turned the steering wheel all eight road wheels not only turned but also tilted in order to bend the tracks and make the tank turn; the idea was to reduce the mechanical strain and waste of power caused by the traditional system used to turn tanks by braking one track.

The turret was a small polygonal turret with heavy armour, but poor situational visibility for spotting approaching aircraft. The Mk III only differed from the Mk II by the position of the radio, which was moved to the hull in order to free some space inside the turret. In regards to protection it was felt to be a better mount than the Mk.I, and the practical rate of fire with 250-320 rounds/minute each increased massively compared to the slow firing single Bofors 40mm, but its effective combat ceiling suffered at being 900m. So a mix of both designs were preferred to be able to combat low and medium height targets."

It was a 33 ton multi-turret design, having a central gun turret armed with a 3 pounder gun (47 mm L/32), and four subsidiary turrets each armed with a 7,7mm Vickers machine gun. The subsidiary turrets were mounted two at the front and two to the rear of the. The gun of the left rear turret was able to elevate to engage aircraft. The tank was designed to have heavy firepower, self-defence capability, and superiority to enemy weapons. Its armour was very thin at a maximum of 38mm, but was increased with the production models. It also incorporated a new hydraulic braking system which had to be specially developed due to its weight and speed.

The Cromwell hull and turret with extra armour and the track and suspension of the 50-ton US M6 Heavy Tank which had been developed for both US and British was used. It was built with a widened Cromwell track and suspension by LMS and different armoured skirts. It only superficially resembled the Churchills. The design was armed with an Ordnance QF 75mm gun.

Its frontal armour was quite heavy at 228mm and its frontal turret had even 254mm. It featured a similar piked prow as later seen on the IS-3. At first it mounted a 94mm Howitzer in the original Valiant I turret, but as this was quite useless against other tanks it was later switched to a 32 pounder (94mm L/50) gun in a redesigned and enlarged turret.

Abandoning the slow Infantry Tank concept, the "Universal Tank or MBT" concept was to design a vehicle with a mobility comparable to that of cruiser tanks, but with the armour and firepower of heavy tanks. The FV 200 series was adopted and was to serve as a multi-purpose line of AFV that used the same hull and chassis. The Caernavon II was a FV 201 chassis fitted with a 20-pounder gun in a Centurion Mk.III turret ( as the initially proposed 17 pounder gun was outdated). However as the Centurion Mk.III versions later proved to be superior to the Caernavon the chassis was used for developing the even heavier Conqueror MBT. The hull was rather weakly armoured with 76mm sloped armour but the turret had armour of 127mm.

After a series of fairly mediocre designs in the A series, and bearing in mind the threat posed by the German 88 mm gun, the War Office demanded a major revision of the design requirements. Initially planned to weigh no more than  41 tons, the final L7 105mm L/52 armed version Mk.III weighed 52 tons instead.  A high top speed was not considered important, while agility was to be equal to that of the Comet using the same Meteor engine. So the new design had excellent performance and a top road speed of 35 km/h. It had a larger hull by adapting the long-travel five-wheel Christie suspension used on the Comet with the addition of a sixth wheel and a simpler Horstmann suspension. The turret had 127mm of armour and the hull was redesigned with welded, sloped armour with a maximum of 110mm.

The Conqueror's role was to provide long range anti-tank support for the Centurion. The chassis was from the A 45 Infantry Support Tank. The armour front armour of 178mm was very heavy for the time. Unfortunately along with the huge turret required for the large gun and very large hull volume, made it very heavy, cumbersome and mechanically unreliable. Also, few bridges could support its weight. However, rather like the Churchill tank, the Conqueror had exceptional terrain handling characteristics and proved to be as capable cross country as the lighter (and on paper slightly faster) Centurion tank.

It had up to 6mm of armor, and could carry 13 passengers. Rather than having a back door for troops to quickly exit, it had three side doors. It had a max speed of 42 kph."

 CCP_submarine_1:0 "AG Class"
 CCP_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 CCP_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shchuka"
 CCP_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV K-Class"
 CCP_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_4:0 "Han Class"
 CCP_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 CCP_destroyer_1:0 "Type 30 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
 CCP_destroyer_2:0 "Type 39 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 CCP_destroyer_3:0 "Type 42 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 CCP_destroyer_4:0 "Type 52 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
 CCP_light_cruiser_1:0 "Type 28C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 CCP_light_cruiser_2:0 "Type 35C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 CCP_light_cruiser_3:0 "Type 44C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 CCP_light_cruiser_4:0 "Type 50C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Type 30HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Type 38HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Type 43HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Type 58HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Type 40BC Class"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Type 51BC Class"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 CCP_battleship_1:0 "Zhou  Class"
 CCP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 CCP_battleship_2:0 "Chen Class"
 CCP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 CCP_battleship_3:0 "Zhu De Class"
 CCP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 CCP_battleship_4:0 "Mao Class"
 CCP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 CCP_sh_battleship_1:0 "Type 50SHBB Project"
 CCP_sh_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 CCP_sh_battleship_2:0 "Type 59SHBB Project"
 CCP_sh_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 CCP_carrier_1:0 "Yulin Class"
 CCP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 CCP_carrier_2:0 "Shanghai Class"
 CCP_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 CCP_carrier_3:0 "Beijing Class"
 CCP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 CCP_carrier_4:0 "Liaoning Class"
 CCP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_06_desc:0 "Developed during the 1920s by the Lanchester Motor Company, the 6x4 had good cross country performance and was easy to maintain. It featured a fully traversing, two-man turret, but the 90 hp engine struggled with the vehicle's weight. First deployed in 1929, it served into the 1930s before being phased out."
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_07:0 "Morris CS9 Armoured Car"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_07_short:0 "Morris CS9"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_07_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Morris Commercial C9 truck, the CS9 replaced a number of WWI-era designs. The open-top turret usually mounted a 13.7 mm Boys anti-tank rifle, and a 7.62 mm Bren light machine gun. The 94 hp engine gave the vehicle good performance on soft ground - when fitted with the correct tires."
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_08:0 "Daimler Mk II Armoured Car"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_08_short:0 "Daimler Mk II"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_08_desc:0 "A heavier development of the successful Daimler Dingo scout car. Produced in large quantities, their welded, sloped hulls were relatively well armoured, while the 4.1 litre 95 hp engine gave decent performance. The armoured car was equipped with a 2 pdr 40mm gun, and a coaxial 7.92 Besa machine gun."
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_09:0 "Humber Mk IV Armoured Car"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_09_short:0 "Humber Mk IV"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_09_desc:0 "Made by the Rootes Group by combining the Indian Army's Karrier KT4 artillery tractor, with the Guy armoured car. The definitive production Mk IV version mounted a US-made 37 mm gun, and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun. The vehicle had a long career and surplus Humbers were sold to nations all over the world."
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_099:0 "AEC Mk II Armoured Car"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_099_short:0 "AEC Mk II"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_099_desc:0 "Built by the Associated Equipment Company on the chassis of their Matador 4x4 artillery tractor. The 158 hp diesel engine enabled the vehicle to mount a 6 pdr 57 mm gun, and coaxial 7.92 mm Besa machine gun, while still maintaining excellent mobility on long patrols. The AEC remained valuable for years to come."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Lt.TK Mk IV"
 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The first dedicated Lt.TKs built by Vickers were turreted developments of the widely exported Carden-Loyd Tankette. Equipped with a Vickers 7.7 mm machine gun, and Horstmann suspension, the Mk IV was the definitive early version of the design. Mk IVs served throughout the Commonwealth but quickly became outdated."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Lt.TK Mk V"
 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The first Commonwealth three-man Lt.TK in service. The extra crew member, and an updated armament of 7.7 mm and 15 mm Besa machine guns in a twin mount, made the Mk V a far more effective combat vehicle. The increase in weight affected mobility on rough ground somewhat, but overall range was largely unchanged."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Lt.TK Mk VI"
 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Built in several versions, and in large quantities. The Mk VIa retained the armament of the Mk V, while the Mk VIb had a compact 15 mm Besa and an upgraded 7.92 mm coaxial. The Mk VIc kept the 7.92 mm coaxial, while the main gun was a long barrel 15 mm Besa, which had excellent muzzle velocity but limited punch."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_4_short:0 "Tetrarch"
 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "Vickers-Armstrong chief tank designer - Leslie Little - designed the Tetrarch as a major upgrade to the Mk VI. It had a 2 pdr 40 mm gun with a 7.92 mm Besa coaxial, and a new coil suspension system. The light weight of the vehicle coupled with the Meadows 165 hp engine, made the Tetratch fast and easy to transport."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_5_short:0 "Harry Hopkins"
 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The last of the Vickers-Armstrong Lt.TKs produced. Developed from the Tetrarch, the length, width, and armour protection of the Mk VIII was increased, and a new power-assisted steering system was installed. Mk VIIIs served in mainly auxillary roles as Commonwealth armoured divisions gradually withdrew Lt.TKs."

After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army. Production ended in 1942, when its main armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1,400 Pz. 38(t)s were manufactured. The chassis of the Pz. 38(t) continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942–1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944–1945) tank destroyers and its derivative vehicles. It was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II that were the Panzerwaffe's main tanks during the outset of WWII. The Panzer 38(t) performed well in the Polish Campaign in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940. It was better armed than the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks. It was on a par with most Lt.TK designs of the era, although it was unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of medium, heavy and infantry tank designs."

These were fitted with an open-top superstructure that provided the gun mount. Around this, four hinged 20 mm armored plates were placed. These plates had two operating positions: they could be lowered for full 360 degree traverse, allowing flat or low-level firing, or they could be half-closed, being pinned together to hang slightly open. In this position, they had notches that allowed the gun full rotation, but only for firing at airborne targets. Still, both of these positions left the crew extremely vulnerable.

On the upper front was a armored shutter which housed a ´leichter Ladungswerfer 200mm´. It was a spigot mortar with 700m range which was withdrawn from regular service. The mortar had a loading chamber which closed off to the interior after the mortar is loaded. Since the mortar shells only weighed 23kg, loading was much easier and faster than with the RW61. It carried a loadout of 76 shells. In addition small 100mm doughnut shaped mortar rounds for point defense for the spigot were carried which would burst 2 meters over the hull and spray the surrounding with shrapnell. Specially trained Combat pioneers accompanied the Rammtiger and stayed in radio contact to coordinate with the close defense mortar use."

Retaining the wing, tail assembly, basic fuselage structure and undercarriage of the Do 217 E-2, the Do 217 P was powered by two supercharged Daimler-Benz DB 603B twelve-cylinder liquid-cooled engines.Instead of using a normal turbo- or supercharger, for the Do 217P the Höhen-Zentrale Anlage (Central Elevation System) was used. The HZ-Anlage consisted of an in the fuselage installed Daimler-Benz DB 605T aircraft engine, which drove a two-stage supercharger that provided high pressure air to the main engines on the wings.

This well-balanced, modern and relatively cheap tank immediately drew the attention of Soviet officers, who felt the need to keep in touch with western technologies. The earliest production model was a twin-turret type. Each turret had an observation slit and a round firing port for the DT machine-gun. These turrets existed in four different models and configurations, although still mounted in the same locations, with the same height and generally same features. All had a 240° arc of fire and armor ranging from 13 to 15 mm (0.51-0.59 in), although the very first 1931 models had only 10 mm of mediocre alloy, susceptible to machine-gun fire. The model 1931 (100 units), 1932 (1361) and 1933 (before upgrading - 576) were all twin-turreted versions. About 2038 were built in all. "

The 45mm L/46 was one of the most powerful anti-tank guns of its time and very few  contemporary western tanks had comparable guns. The T-26 could carry up to three secondary DT 7.62mm machine guns in coaxial, rear, and anti-aircraft mounts.  The tank was powered by a T-26 90 HP flat row 4-cylinder air-cooled petrol engine, which was a copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton.

This proved insufficient in the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938, so the tank was upgraded once more in February 1939 to have an underturret box with sloped (23°) 20 mm armoured plates. The turret featured an armour increase to 20 mm at 18 degrees sloping. This time it was designated T-26-1 (known as the T-26 mod. 1939 in modern sources).

A notable feature was the commander's cupola. This would not appear on other Soviet tanks until 1942, which instead relied on panoramic periscopes. The 45mm 20K gun was housed - as break from previous Soviet light tanks - in a three-man turret as was the case on medium and heavy tanks such as the T-28, T-35 and KV-1. Additionally, all T-50s had radios, a feature only found on the commander's vehicle of earlier light tanks. It was very complicated to produce for such a small tank of 14 tons and despite being much more capable the cheap T-60 was preferred. It had a model V4 diesel engine with 300 HP allowing a very high top road speed of 60 km/h."

Although at first intended to carry a 12.7 mm machine gun like the T-40, the armament was later upgraded to the 20 mm TNSh cannon, a tank version of the ShVAK. It had a maximum armour of 20mm on the sloped hull and 15mm on the turret and weighed 5,8 tons. A GAZ-202 with 70 HP powered it and allowed a maximum road speed of 44 km/h. Whilst such a large number were produced, it was hated by all who had to deal with it – all except the Germans ( which had a similar burden with the Panzer-I, although it was not supposed to fight), who found it to be a substandard and underwhelming opponent, and a rather nice ammunition carrier or gun towing tractor, once captured. Apart from the slightly better hull protection and easier producability it essentially was a downgrade to the old T-26 in fighting performance."

 light_soviet_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "The T-70 was yet another stop-gap in Soviet tank production. The performance of soviet light tanks - which were expected to fight - of that time was abysmal, despite prolific production, whilst T-34 production suffered from problems. These tanks were horrendous owing to their poor maneuverability, weak guns, and inferior armor. The T-70 was an attempt by N.A. Astrov to counter these three problems. Whilst the 45mm gun was generally better suited to the reality of tank-on-tank warfare, it still had poor mobility. Armour thickness on the turret front was 60 mm, hull front and sides: 45 mm. The tank’s legacy passed on into the somewhat well-known SU-76 self-propelled gun, which was also a less than desirable tank. The T-70 was armed with a 45-mm L/46 gun Model 38 with forty-five rounds carried, and a coaxial 7.62-mm DT machine gun.

The ZiS-3 was placed at the rear, protected by an enclosed 10-35 mm thick sloped armored casemate, however the vehicle was not completely enclosed by armour, the rear roof and upper rear side was exposed. Its simple construction made it the second most produced Soviet armoured vehicle of World War II, after the T-34 tank.  It was also nicknamed ´Golozhopiy Ferdinand´ ( "bare-arsed Ferdinand") due to its very light armor and somewhat similar silhouette, when compared to the german 65 tons Ferdinand tank destroyer.  The gun had a coaxial DT machine-gun and the crew of three also carried personal firearms. Until 1945 factories would deliver no less than 13,932 vehicles. It had the more powerful twin GAZ-203 engines with a combined power of 170 HP allowing a top road speed of 45 km/h."

The frontal gun mounting allowed a vertical move from -3 to +26 degrees and ten degrees to either side.

It also had serious flaws: the transmission (a twenty-year-old Holt Caterpillar design) was the main problem, there was some truth to rumors of Soviet drivers having to shift gears with a hammer and it was difficult to steer. The KV-1 had a weight of 45 tons and powered by the 550 hp V12 engine a top road speed of 40km/h could be reached.

The 85 mm proved capable of penetrating the Tiger I from 1000 m and the demand for it slowed production of the KV-85 tremendously. The KV-85 appeared on the front beginning in September 1943 and its production ended by December 1943. Soviet industry was therefore able to produce a heavy tank as well armed as the Tiger I before the end of 1943. Although the KV-85 was an excellent opponent to the Tigers and Panthers, it was essentially a stopgap once the IS tank entered full-scale production."

 #"Heavy tank destroyer based on the KV-1. This rather curious development for an assault gun was an attempt to increase the firepower of the KV-chassis. At first trials were made with a casemate system housing the U-13 system incorporating two 45mm and one 76,2 guns to fire all at once or separate. This configuration was quickly forbidden by Stalin himself in December´41 and another configuration was found with the U-14 system incorporating two 76,2mm F-34 guns side by side ( with a 15°gun traverse each to the sides). In theory a salvo would consist of one gun firing, reloading and in the time the first gun reloads the second gun aims and fires... again in theory roughly raising the firing speed from approx.5 shots/minute for the F34 to 10 shots/minute, in reality it was much lower. However since the front casemate was heavily armoured with 85mm and around 20cm lower than the KV-1, it was hard to kill. With its Model V2K engine providing 600 HP its top road speed was 43km/h."

Instead it was later developed to be armed with a long barreled 122mm L/36 (A-19) Howitzer with a range of almost 20km. Like with the SU-6, it could rotate fully. The armour ranged from 8-20 mm, with 15 mm folding screens to protect the crew, however these were only usable when the gun was pointing forward. Of the two variants of the SPG the one with a front mounted gun was chosen. The base of the SU-8 was an obsolete T-28 chassis. The model with the frontal mounted gun was weighing 21,8 tons and its M-17T engine with 680 HP gave it a top road speed of 40 km/h."

It mounted a 152 mm gun-howitzer on the chassis of a KV-1S heavy tank. Because of its impromptu success as heavy tank destroyer, capable of knocking out  of the heaviest german AFV´s — Tiger and Panther tanks (even ripping off their turrets) — it was nicknamed Zveroboy ("Beast Slayer"). Disadvantages were a low rate of fire due to the heavy 2-piece ammo, only 20 rounds onboard and a cramped, unergonomic crew compartment. Its armour was 65 mm of 30-degree sloped frontal armor, which still left it vulnerable frontally to the 88mm KwK36 guns at long range and the 75mm KwK40 gun at medium and short ranges. The ML-20S was mounted to the right of centre with a limited traverse in a range of 12 degrees.

Being overweight despite its wooden construction, it was too heavy for its engine and sluggish. It was originally designed for the powerful Klimov M-106 engine, but it proved to be unreliable, so it was necessary to install the relatively weak Klimov M-105P. As a result, the LaGG was slow: its top speed was just 580 km/h. In combat the LaGG-3's main advantage was its strong airframe, however the laminated wood shattered when hit by high explosive rounds, although it did not burn.

Construction throughout was all-metal, and like its predecessor, its horizontal stabiliser was mounted high to avoid gasses from the underwing cannons. Once again, however, trials proved the concept a failure.

 pe_8_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Development of the Pe-8 began in July 1934, when the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) issued requirements for an aircraft to replace the obsolete and cumbersome Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber. The resulting aircraft was a four-engined, mid-wing cantilever monoplane built mainly of duralumin, with two steel spars in the wings, although the ailerons were fabric-covered. The defensive armament consisted of twin 7,62mm ShKAS in the nose, twin 12,7mm UBT in the nacelle barbettes and in the tail and dorsal turrets with a twin 20mm ShVAK. The bomb bay was modified to allow for a single 5,000-kilogram FAB-5000 bomb to be carried over a range of 3700km.The arrests of both Tupolev and Petlyakov in October 1937, during the Great Purge, disrupted the program and after problems to find suitable engines they were fitted eventually in 1940 with supercharged Mikulin AM-35A engines providing 1350 HP each and allowing a maximum speed of 443 km/h."

At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted in favor of a manually operated ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose. This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the former diesel-engined versions - around 5000km - but reliability was greatly improved and maximum speed increased to 490km/h."

Thanks to the heavy armor protection, the Il-2 could take a great deal of punishment and proved difficult to shoot down, however heavy losses to enemy fighters forced the reintroduction of a rear gunner; early Il-2s were field modified for a gunner sitting on a canvas sling armed with a 12.7 mm UBT machine gun until a proper 2-seater was introduced. Armament were two forward-firing 20mm ShVAK and two 7,62mm ShKAS machine guns and one manually aimed 12,7mm Berezin UBT machine gun in rear cockpit, up to 600 kg bombs and 8 × RS-82 rockets or 4 × RS-132 rockets."

Performance and handling were much improved from the resulting shift of the Il-2's aerodynamic center rearwards with the revised "arrow wing" planform to correct the earlier problem, and this became the most common version of the Il-2. It was propelled by a Mikulin AM-38F with 1720 HP allowing a maximum speed of 410 km/h. The 20mm ShVAKs were upgraded to 23mm VYa-23 cannons.

But the VVS gave up the idea of heavy armoured fighters, due to their low speed, which was not enough to intercept modern bombers. As a result, Ilyushin decided to turn the Il-1 into a two-seat ground attack plane, with the designation changed to Il-10 in early 1944. The armament was identical to the Il-2 but all MG´s were later upgraded to 20mm.

The F4F-4 was the definitive version. However this version was less popular with American pilots because the same amount of ammunition was spread over two additional guns resulting in a meagre 240 rounds-per-gun (rpg). Extra guns and folding wings also meant extra weight and reduced performance: the F4F-4 was capable of only about 512 km/h."

The Hellcat competed with the faster Vought F4U Corsair for that role and prevailed, as the Corsair had significant issues with carrier landings. Powered by a 2,000 HP Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp, the same powerplant used for both the Corsair and the P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, the F6F was an entirely new design with numerous improvements, but it still resembled the Wildcat in many ways. Some military observers tagged the Hellcat as the "Wildcat's big brother". Having the same six 12,7mm machine guns but with much more ammunition per gun ( 600 rpg), the worst problem of the F4F was rectified. All in all it was a very successful and rugged aircraft design and well liked by its pilots."

The R-2800 was the most powerful American engine available at that time, so it would be retained for the successor F8F. This meant that improved performance would have to come from a completely redesigned and lighter airframe, which then also had to be able to operate from the much smaller escort carriers. The weight reduction measures included among other things a shortening of the aircraft, different wing folding arrangements, less fuel storage and thus range and only four 12,7mm machine guns. The advantages of the 20% weight reduction compared to the F6F were e.g. a 30% better climb rate and a speed boost of about 80 km/h bringing it to a maximum airspeed of 730 km/h."

 us_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Douglas O-46 was the main production version of the Douglas family of monoplane observation aircraft, and the first to use a radial engine. Two major changes from earlier versions were introduced on this version. First was the use of a 725 HP Pratt & Whitney R-1535-7 air cooled engine in place of the engine used on the O-31 and O-43. The second was the introduction of parallel streamlined struts below the wings, replacing the wire bracing and cabane of the earlier versions. The O-46A entered service in 1936. A 1939 report from Fort Lewis described the O-46 as a 'very nice fair weather cross country aircraft for a pilot who is in no hurry', too slow to outrun enemy fighters, too heavy to out-manoeuvre them, too heavy for wet fields, too slow to take off on enclosed fields and too large to hide under trees. It could carry a small bomb load at a speed of 275 km/h over a range of 1000 km and its defensive armament consisted of two 7,62mm machine guns."

It needed still further development and the armament was barely adequate at that time, but the decision was made to put it in production immediately and improve it "on the way". Although the armour was riveted, the 30mm frontal and the side armours were well sloped and gave the tank some protection at least against the british 2 pounder.

A novelty was the placement of the final reduction gears inside the front-mounted drive sprockets, eliminating the need for enlarged final drive housings in the bow armour. Service use of the M11/39 was short due to several deficiencies in its design, particularly the placement of the main 37mm L/40 gun in the hull due to insufficient turret space which instead housed dual 8 mm machine guns. The M11/39 had other shortcomings: its endurance and performance were poor, and its SPA V8-diesel with 105 HP was underpowered only allowing a relatively slow top road speed of 32 km/h, it was mechanically unreliable and its 30 mm maximum riveted steel armour could only withstand 20 mm fire but was vulnerable to British 2-pounder guns at any range."

It was a completely unprotected weapon as the long gun barrel was placed on an open mounting carried on the turretless tank chassis. The gun crew stood in the open to serve the gun that had its trunnions mounted right to the rear to absorb some of the recoil forces produced on firing. The Cannone da 149/40 modello 35 could fire a 46 kg shell to a range of 23,7km, at which distance the lack of protection for the gun crew was thought of relatively little importance. The 250 HP engine allowed the 24 ton vehicle a top road speed of 22 km/h."

ITA_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Semovente 149/40 grants long-range fire-support to the troops, but offers little protection to its own crew. Due to the vulnerability of the vehicle and its crew against occasional counter battery fire and aircraft, it was decided to lenghten the chassis and add a rear crew compartment armoured with 10mm which was open topped and also open toward the rear, where the recoiling gun needed space. The mounted cannone da 152mm L/45 was originally developed for dreadnoughts or siege artillery. The onboard ammunition loadout could almost be doubled, allowing more intensive barrages. Since the weight increased to 29 tons the engine had to be upgraded to 320 HP, allowing a top road speed of 20 km/h."

To increase flexibility and protection to the crew it was placed in a fully traversable turret armoured with 20mm. Its power was provided by a V12 diesel engine developing 420 HP, allowing the 42 tons vehicle a top road speed of 36 km/h. The gun fired a 101kg shell over 15km. Due to the massive recoil the chassis had 4 chassis mounted trunnions which were lowered to the ground and arrested prior to firing, to fire unbraced would have damaged the suspension. Although the range was lower than the smaller guns due to the shorter barrel, the better mobility of the chassis and gun elevation of 70° and the heavier shell made it a better system."

In addition, the Semovente da 90/53 had little or no armour in most areas. Using the same engine as the M14/41 with 145 HP, it was underpowered and mobility suffered.
