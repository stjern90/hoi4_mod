 japsov.1.t: "Soviet Invasion of Manchuria and Korea"
 japsov.1.d: "With the end of the fascist threat to the west it's now time to end the imperialistic ambitions of Japan once and for all. Japan is already at war and left their border with the Soviet Union completely empty which is an excellent chance for us to break the non-aggression pact and invade Manchuria and Korea to claim them as a part of our sphere of influence."
 japsov.1.a: "Invade Manchuria at once and destroy Japan."
 japsov.1.b: "Don't intervene - China was never important to us anyway."
 japsov.2.t: "The End of the Soviet Union"
 japsov.2.d: "German Reich has advanced deep against the Soviet Union. With the loss of three key cities - Moscow, Stalingrad and Leningrad - Stalin has no choice, but to surrender to the Germans. If we don't act now Germany will claim the entire Soviet Union territory as part of their new Reichkomissariats from Siberia to as far as Vladivostok. That cannot happen. We have to break the treaty with the Soviets and invade them unless we want German military bases at our doorstep."
 japsov.2.a: "Invite the Germans to occupied Vladivostok and partition the Soviet territory with them."
 japsov.2.b: "Vladivostok is not important. Let the Germans have it."
 japsov.3.t: "The End of the Soviet Union"
 japsov.3.d: "Bolshevik Russia since its inception in 1917 has expanded considerably, but eventually fallen into despair with the occurring invasion of the Axis powers led by the Nazi Germany. German forces were competent enough to capture Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad while Vladivostok was claimed by the forces of the Imperial Japan. With the imminent end of the Soviet Union and the following end of the communism in Europe comes the new danger of war between Germany and Japan. The planned peace conference in Vladivostok will show whether Germany and Japan can agree to terms to divide the former Soviet territory. Meanwhile Joseph Stalin had disappeared completely and left Russia possibly through Iran or Afghanistan to seek help elsewhere."
 japsov.3.a: "What does it mean for us?"
 japsov.3.b: "The era of the communism is finally over."
 japsov.4.t: "Peace Treaty of Vladivostok"

 japsov.5.t: "Peace Treaty of Vladivostok"

 japsov.5.a: "Let the era of peace and prosperity between Germany and Japan begin."
 japsov.5.b: "Treaty with Japan? They are next to be conquered by our armies."
 japsov.6.t: "New Mongol Empire?"
 japsov.6.d: "As we control a part of former Mongolian Empire we can return it to our loyal ally."

 japsov.7.t: "Tuva to Mongolia?"
 japsov.7.d: "As we control a part of former Mongolian Empire we can return it to our loyal ally."
 japsov.7.a: "Give Tuva to Mengjiang."
 japsov.7.b: "They have enough land."
 japsov.8.t: "The New Era for Mongolia"
 japsov.8.d: "Our Japanese allies have granted us new territory that we can core. All we have to do is claim that our regime is the true and legal regime of the entire Mongolia."
 japsov.8.a: "From now on Mengjiang will be Mongolia and Mongolia will be Mengjiang."
 japsov.8.b: "We didn't ask for any of this."
 japsov.9.t: "Future of China and Korea"
 japsov.9.d: "We currently control some of the territory within China and we have a choice of either annexing this land into the Soviet Union or releasing the friendly regime in Korea and returning the rest of the land to our allies from Communist Party of China."
 japsov.9.a: "Soviet Union, China and Korea will become the three pillars of communism in Asia."
 japsov.9.b: "One Soviet Union to rule all of Asia."
 japsov.10.t: "The end of Mengjiang"
 japsov.10.d: "The idea of Inner Mongolia disappears together with the disappearance of Mengukuo from the map."

 japsov.11.b: "Don't."
 japsov.12.t: "The Soviet Influence Grows"
 japsov.12.d: "The Soviet leaders offer us a military assistance in our future endeavours. This will likely mean that we become their puppet."

 japsov.12.b: "We're not interested."
 japsov.13.t: "Mongolia Refuses"

 chijap.1.d: "We've conquered everything that was to conquer in China. Our rule over China is now secured and undisputed. Now we have a choice to make on how to divide the conquered lands between our loyal allies and associates. We've reached an agreement with Wang Jingwei and some of the loyal warlords to give them control over the majority of lands to the North-West, while we are about to retain the direct control over the key coastal ports as well as Cantonese China, Yunnan and the key transport routes into Burma and Indochina.

 chijap.2.t: "Tibet in Co-Prosperity Sphere?"
 chijap.2.d: "As we control the entirety of China we can now propose the formal alliance to Tibet. We could probably persuade them to join our cause by promising the transfer of the Xikang which was a province of the Tibetan Empire long ago."
 chijap.2.a: "Propose alliance to Tibet. Xikang means nothing."
 chijap.2.b: "Keep Xikang. Tibet means nothing."
 chijap.3.t: "Tibet in Co-Prosperity Sphere?"
 chijap.3.d: "Delegates from Japan want to sell us the province of Xikang and accept our accession into Co-Prosperity Sphere. We would restore the old lands of Tibet, but the price we would have to pay would be a probable war with India and Japanese occupation of our territory."
 chijap.3.a: "Japanese are going to win the war. Accept Xikang and join them."

Phibun, at the time a lieutenant colonel, quickly rose to prominence in the military as a "man-on-horseback". The 1932 coup was followed by the nationalization of some companies and increasing state control of the economy. The following year, Phibun and allied military officers successfully crushed the Boworadet Rebellion, a royalist revolt led by Prince Boworadet. While King Prajadhipok was not involved in the rebellion, it marked the beginning of a slide which ended in his abdication and replacement by King Ananda Mahidol in 1935."

 polsovwar.2.t: "Soviets Troops Crossed the Border in the East"
 polsovwar.2.d: "Poland is in desperate position: left between two hostile superpowers - Germany to the west and the Soviet Union to the east. With the ongoing invasion of western Poland by Germany we've limited resources to stop any attack from the Soviet side. Unfortunately our allies in the west are absolutely against the war with the Soviet Union, so if we choose to fight another war against the Soviet Union we will be alone in it. Our only choice is to either order our troops to stop shooting at the Red Army soldiers and abandon the eastern lands or fight to the bitter end - alone and without any allies." 
 polsovwar.2.a: "We're doomed. Order the troops to not engage the enemy unless it's in self-defence (historical)." 
 polsovwar.2.b: "Fight with the Soviets! Do not abandon eastern lands!" 
 polsovwar.3.t: "Polish Army Capitulates"
 polsovwar.3.d: "The invasion of the Soviet Red Army brought a swift capitulation of the eastern garrisons and army groups of Poland. Most of the units were quickly encircled, neutralized and destroyed. There's also immesurable ammount of weapons and POWs left in our hands. Polish Army command even gave the orders to not shoot back at the advancing Soviet troops - basically leaving the entire eastern Poland in our hands." 
 polsovwar.3.a: "Quick and significant victory. Poland had no chance." 
 polsovwar.4.t: "Poland Fights Back"
 polsovwar.4.d: "Polish Army command ordered the troops to shoot back at us. It seems that the invasion of Poland won't go as smoothly as we've planned. Fortunately the allies of Poland are not interested in fighting and abandoned Poland leaving all of the Polish lands in our hands." 
 polsovwar.4.a: "Let's crush them..."

 irqirn.20.t: "Legal status of Egypt"
 irqirn.20.d: "The Kingdom of Egypt, known also as The Egyptian Kingdom is the current legal form of the Egyptian state during the Muhammad Ali dynasty's reign since the United Kingdom's recognition of Egyptian Independence in 1922. The truth is that Egypt is only nominally independent with the United Kingdom retaining control of foreign relations, communications, the military and Sudan."
 irqirn.20.a: "Promise the Egyptians to leave their territory eventually... (historical)"
 irqirn.20.b: "Occupy Egypt!"
 irqirn.21.t: "Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936"
 irqirn.21.d: "Under the terms of the treaty, the United Kingdom is required to withdraw all its troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings, numbering 10,000 troops plus auxiliary personnel. Additionally, the United Kingdom would supply and train Egypt's army and assist in its defence in case of war. The treaty is going to last for 20 years. It was negotiated in the Zaafarana palace and signed in London to be later ratified and registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series."
 irqirn.21.a: "Egypt will slowly gain it's independence."
 irqirn.22.t: "Withdrawal from Egypt"
 irqirn.22.d: "Under the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 we're required to withdraw all its troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings. It's now the time to finally do so."
 irqirn.22.a: "Shouldn't have promised to retreat back in 1936..."
 irqirn.22.t: "End of the Egyptian Occupation"
 irqirn.22.d: "Today under the modified terms of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian treaty the British forces left the Egyptian territory and left only a small garrison of troops to defend Suez Canal. Only time will tell whether it will be possible to maintain friendly relations between Egypt and the United Kingdom over the control of the Suez Canal."
 irqirn.22.a: "Egypt is fully independent now, but Suez stays in British hands."
