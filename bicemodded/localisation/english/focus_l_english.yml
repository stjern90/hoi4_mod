 CAN_lay_west_claims_desc:0 "The US presence in the west is unacceptable. We had previously argued with the US on this very topic before over the Lynn Canal but we must be bolder in opposition to the internation tribunal's decision. We must have all of Alaska for ourselves if we are to secure our borders properly."

 CAN_question_of_quebec:0 "Conscription Plebiscite"
 CAN_question_of_quebec_desc:0 "We must hold a plebiscite on the rules of conscriptions, where they may be used and to what degree the provinces must commit.

 CAN_force_quebec:0 "Place Québec under Curfew"
 CAN_force_quebec_desc:0 "The results of the plebiscite have clearly shown that the majority of Canada is for the conscription changes, with the exception of Quebec. They were the sole majority voter against these changes and continue to obstruct the process.

 CAN_quebec_agreement:0 "The Québec Agreement"
 CAN_quebec_agreement_desc:0 "We should hold a tripartite meeting with the USA and the UK in regards to a new weapons project.

 CAN_nuclear_arms:0 "The White Stars of the North"
 CAN_nuclear_arms_desc:0 "Our lands are rich in many materials, including uranium. By studying this material we could potentially make weapons that would bring horror to our enemies. It may also be prudent to research other ways to deliver frightening destruction from afar."

 NZL_department_of_housing_construction_desc:0 "A policy of the elected government of 1935, we can issue tenders for the mass construction of new homes for our citizens. Such large-scale operations involve standardisation of parts and fittings to a much greater extent than previously seen in our country."
 NZL_public_works_department:0 "Public Works Department"
 NZL_public_works_department_desc:0 "Most public works are being carried out by the Unemployment Board, and focused on the relief of unemployment. We can transfer these to the Public Works Deparment, and expand genuine works activity by importing earth-moving machinery."
 NZL_highway_construction:0 "Highways and Road Works"
 NZL_highway_construction_desc:0 "We have increased the efficiency of our public works. Now we can expand the Public Works Deparment, and build new roads for our country."
 NZL_import_restrictions:0 "Import Restrictions"
 NZL_import_restrictions_desc:0 "One step we are considering is restricting imports of many manufactured goods, to encourage local manufacturing. This proved haphazard in it's effects, but encouraged many industries that did important work during the war years ahead."
 NZL_diversification_of_economy:0 "Encourage Private Industry"
 NZL_diversification_of_economy_desc:0 "Through government orders and subsidies, we can encourage the development of local manufacturing."
 NZL_power_development:0 "Develop Hydro-Electric Power"

 NZL_extra_tech_slot:0 "Task Universities with Research"
 NZL_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "We have developed our economy to be more self-sufficient. New ideas are being created and tested. We can fund various projects to help develop our country further.

 NZL_pass_social_security_act_desc:0 "Combining a comprehensive array of welfare benefits with free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare, the Social Security Act of 1938 was intended to protect New Zealanders from the cradle to the grave. It sustained both a safety net and trust in government during the tough decisions ahead, but critics claimed the welfare state was too expensive and encouraged dependence."
 NZL_accept_maori_battalion:0 "Accept Offer of Maori Battalion"
 NZL_accept_maori_battalion_desc:0 "As war seemed inevitable, Sir Apirana Ngata and other Maori leaders proposed the formation of a unit formed from Maori volunteers. The Maori Battalion went on to be the most decorated New Zealand battalion during the war."
 NZL_civilian_manpower_controls:0 "Enact Civilian Manpower Controls"
 NZL_civilian_manpower_controls_desc:0 "Our country has a strong tradition of organised labour. Regulations reducing overtime rates to boost production are meeting overt resistance and strikes. However, restrictions on stopping essential war work have much the same effect and are more accepted, although critics liken them to conscription."
 NZL_pass_the_manpower_act:0 "Pass the Manpower Act"
 NZL_pass_the_manpower_act_desc:0 "Due to historic wage agreements, different rates of pay are draining many essential industries of skilled workers. Attempts to renegotiate these terms are meeting overt resistance and strikes. This act allows us to transfer our scarce workforce to work of national importance, including women. In effect industrial conscription, our country's sense of shared sacrifice allows us to take this measure."
 # Rearmament

Being able to store perishable food is critical for sustaining our economy and supplying our allies."
 NZL_duplicate_rolling_mill:0 "Steel and Iron in the South Island"

 NZL_workshop_production:0 "Charlton Motor Workshops"
 NZL_workshop_production_desc:0 "British weapons are in short supply as the UK rearms. An engineer by the name of Philip Charlton has developed a kit to convert Boer War-era rifles into light machine guns. Historically 1500 were built. Although considered inferior to a new-built Bren, it was available, lighter and worked perfectly and reliably during testing."
 NZL_truck_assembly_plant:0 "Truck Assembly Plants"
 NZL_truck_assembly_plant_desc:0 "We have a number of assembly plants for cars and trucks, most in the Wellington region. We can expand production by manufacturing licensed parts in small workshops, and using our existing plants for assembly."
 NZL_armor_effort:0 "Local Production"
 NZL_armor_effort_desc:0 "We can develop our subcontracting further, producing and assemblying components for armoured cars and other light armoured vehicles, both licensed and home-designed. Historically 1300 tracked carriers, and other vehicles, were produced. The General Motors plant in Wellington was the most notable factory involved."
 NZL_armor_effort2:0 "Domestic Designs"
 NZL_armor_effort2_desc:0 "With foreign sales cut off, a number of citizens have proposed basic light tank designs we can construct ourselves.

 NZL_armor_salvage:0 "Refurbish Salvaged Equipment"
 NZL_armor_salvage_desc:0 "The spoils of war belong to the victor. Our forces in the field have 'acquired' some damaged or abandoned tanks and other armoured vehicles of various types. These can be put back in the field under new ownership with a modest amount of effort."

 NZL_2NZEF:0 "Form the 2NZEF"
 NZL_2NZEF_desc:0 "New Zealanders in combat will probably be doing so well distant to our shores. Only abroad can those who threaten our interests be defeated. We can start creating the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force."

 NZL_operations_middle_east:0 "Planning Effort for Middle East"
 NZL_operations_middle_east_desc:0 "Just as we fought in the Suez, Sinai and Palestine in the Great War, so we may be asked to fight again in the scorching sands. Our lines of supply are shorter here, and the Commonwealth sees us as hardy colonials suited to hard terrain."
 NZL_operations_pacific:0 "Planning Effort for Pacific"
 NZL_operations_pacific_desc:0 "Our home cannot be neglected. The security of the Pacific has always required any attacker from the North to be delayed until the Royal Navy can muster it's strength."
 # Aviation

 NZL_radio_industry:0 "Radio Industry"
 NZL_radio_industry_desc:0 "Our fledgling radio industry is expanding rapidly to cope with our own needs. We can expand further to export additional radios and even radar units to our allies."
 # Singapore
 NZL_singapore_focus:0 "The Singapore Strategy"
 NZL_singapore_focus_desc:0 "From the 1920's our core defence policy has been to rely on Royal Navy assistance, sustained by a fortified naval base. It's status as a symbol of Imperial commitment helped obscure the growing strategic weaknesses in the strategy. Historically New Zealand helped fund the Naval base, which was finished in 1939."
 NZL_singapore_forts:0 "Contribute to Landward Forts"
 NZL_singapore_forts_desc:0 "For better or for worse, work on the grandly-named 'Fortress Singapore' goes slowly. The Singapore Strategy as written requires Australasia to hold on until the Royal Navy can arrive. Contributing to defence works is an option we can choose. Historically the UK started work on ground fortifications, unfinished when invasion occurred."
 # Naval Tree
 NZL_naval_effort:0 "Develop Shipbuilding"
 NZL_naval_effort_desc:0 "Our country has an established, if modest, shipbuilding industry. Historically, shipyard expansion for repairs and the construction of minesweepers and smaller craft occurred from 1940. However, our citizens and policies support industrialisation, and we can focus on shipbuilding now if we so choose."
 NZL_navy_doctrine:0 "Our Place in the World"

 NZL_destroyer_effort2:0 "Patrol Craft"
 NZL_destroyer_effort2_desc:0 "Our waters need defenders. We can start planning for the construction of smaller craft on our own initiative. Historically motor launches were constructed that saw service in the island campaigns. In total nearly 500 vessels were constructed during the war, and at least partial repairs done on over 1000 US ships."
 NZL_navy_doctrine2:0 "Form the RNZN"
 NZL_navy_doctrine2_desc:0 "As the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, due to expansion our forces are largely self-sufficient and independent of the Royal Navy. Identifying our navy as our own recognises this fact. Historically this occurred 1 October 1941."
 NZL_cruiser_effort:0 "British Cruiser Designs"

 # Island Defence
 NZL_fiji_focus:0 "Defence of the Local Islands"
 NZL_fiji_focus_desc:0 "Our means may be limited, but we can still look to our own defence. To the west lies the bulwark of Australia. The most direct threat to our trade and freedom will come from the north. We can build a base in Fiji to help protect our coastal waters."
 NZL_fiji_focus2:0 "Reinforce Fiji"
 NZL_fiji_focus2_desc:0 "We can further develop the installations in our northern neighbour."
 # Look Outside the Commonwealth
 NZL_technology_sharing:0 "Mutual Aid"
 NZL_technology_sharing_desc:0 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime R&D more efficiently."
 NZL_political_effort:0 "Look Beyond the Commonwealth"
 NZL_political_effort_desc:0 "New powers are arising in the Pacific, and Britain is occupied ever-more distantly in Europe. While our ties to Britain may remain, our country's needs may require us to look at other options as well. Historically this occurred during the close cooperation with the US needed during the Pacific campaign, and the reality of a US-dominated Pacific after the end of the war."
 NZL_collectivist_ethos:0 "Collectivist Ethos"

 NZL_volunteer_corps:0 "Volunteer Corps"
