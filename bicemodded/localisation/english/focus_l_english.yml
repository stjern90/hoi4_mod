 NZL_pass_social_security_act:0 "Pass Social Security Act"
 NZL_pass_social_security_act_desc:0 "Combining a comprehensive array of welfare benefits with free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare, the Social Security Act of 1938 was intended to protect New Zealanders from the cradle to the grave. It sustained both a safety net and trust in government during the tough decisions ahead, but critics claimed the welfare state was too expensive and encouraged dependence."
 NZL_accept_maori_battalion:0 "Accept Offer of Maori Battalion"
 NZL_accept_maori_battalion_desc:0 "As war seemed inevitable, Sir Apirana Ngata and other Maori leaders proposed the formation of a unit formed from Maori volunteers. The Maori Battalion went on to be the most decorated New Zealand battalion during the war."
 NZL_civilian_manpower_controls:0 "Enact Civilian Manpower Controls"
 NZL_civilian_manpower_controls_desc:0 "Our country has a strong tradition of organised labour. Regulations reducing overtime rates to boost production are meeting overt resistance and strikes. However, restrictions on stopping essential war work have much the same effect and are more accepted, although critics liken them to conscription."
 NZL_pass_the_manpower_act:0 "Pass the Manpower Act"
 NZL_pass_the_manpower_act_desc:0 "Due to historic wage agreements, different rates of pay are draining many essential industries of skilled workers. Attempts to renegotiate these terms are meeting overt resistance and strikes. This act allows us to transfer our scarce workforce to work of national importance, including women. In effect industrial conscription, our country's sense of shared sacrifice allows us to take this measure."
 # Rearmament
 NZL_early_rearmament:0 "Rearmament"

 # War Economy
 NZL_cool_storage:0 "Increase Refrigerated Storage"
 NZL_cool_storage_desc:0 "We are a farming nation with 30 million sheep and 2 million dairy cows, and in times of war shipping may be in short supply. Our largest contribution to the war effort is to continue supplies of vital food for citizens and soldiers abroad. Being able to store perishable food is critical for sustaining our economy and supplying our allies."
 NZL_duplicate_rolling_mill:0 "Steel and Iron in the South Island"
 NZL_duplicate_rolling_mill_desc:0 "We have a steel rolling mill in Dunedin and rich deposits of high-grade iron ore in Onekaka. We can restart iron smelting in Onekaka and duplicate the rolling mill, to feed the demands of our economy."

 NZL_workshop_production:0 "Charlton Motor Workshops"
 NZL_workshop_production_desc:0 "British weapons are in short supply as the UK rearms. An engineer by the name of Philip Charlton has developed a kit to convert Boer War-era rifles into light machine guns. Historically 1500 were built. Although considered inferior to a new-built Bren, it was available, lighter and worked perfectly and reliably during testing."
 NZL_truck_assembly_plant:0 "Truck Assembly Plants"
 NZL_truck_assembly_plant_desc:0 "We have a number of assembly plants for cars and trucks, most in the Wellington region. We can expand production by manufacturing licensed parts in small workshops, and using our existing plants for assembly."
 NZL_armor_effort:0 "Local Production"
 NZL_armor_effort_desc:0 "We can develop our subcontracting further, producing and assemblying components for armoured cars and other light armoured vehicles, both licensed and home-designed. Historically 1300 tracked carriers, and other vehicles, were produced. The General Motors plant in Wellington was the most notable factory involved."
 NZL_armor_effort2:0 "Domestic Designs"
 NZL_armor_effort2_desc:0 "With foreign sales cut off, a number of citizens have proposed basic light tank designs we can construct ourselves. Historically the best of these was the Schofield tank, the improved version mounting a 2 pdr gun. Further development was stopped when US tanks became available in quantity."
 NZL_armor_vickers:0 "License Vickers Light Tank Design"
 NZL_armor_vickers_desc:0 "Earlier Vickers designs have been widely exported, and produced under license by both Poland and the Soviet Union. Our friends in the Mother Country are willing for us to produce the Vickers Light Mk.VI under license."

 NZL_armor_m3:0 "License M3 Lee Design"
 NZL_armor_m3_desc:0 "Should British designs prove unsuitable or delayed, we can seek the assistance of the great Arsenal of Democracy. Historically, Canada built licensed M3 chassis for their Ram Tanks, although they did not see combat."
 NZL_armor_m4:0 "License M4 Sherman Design"
 NZL_armor_m4_desc:0 "The M3 was succeeded by the superior Sherman. Historically the Allies agreed to standardise on the M4, and Canada produced their own version under license as the Grizzly."
 NZL_armor_salvage:0 "Refurbish Salvaged Equipment"
 NZL_armor_salvage_desc:0 "The spoils of war belong to the victor. Our forces in the field have 'acquired' some damaged or abandoned tanks and other armoured vehicles of various types. These can be put back in the field under new ownership with a modest amount of effort."
 NZL_mechanization_effort:0 "Mechanisation of Support Arms"
 NZL_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "We can focus our planning efforts on increased mechanisation of our infantry and their support arms."

 NZL_2NZEF:0 "Form the 2NZEF"
 NZL_2NZEF_desc:0 "New Zealanders in combat will probably be doing so well distant to our shores. Only abroad can those who threaten our interests be defeated. We can start creating the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force."
 NZL_home_guard:0 "Form the Home Guard"
 NZL_home_guard_desc:0 "We can form a volunteer militia for home defence."
 NZL_coastal_forts:0 "Upgrade Coastal Defences"

 NZL_operations_europe_desc:0 "The defining conflict will be once again in Western Europe, where our fallen from the last War lie from Flanders Fields and the Somme."
 NZL_operations_middle_east:0 "Planning Effort for Middle East"
 NZL_operations_middle_east_desc:0 "Just as we fought in the Suez, Sinai and Palestine in the Great War, so we may be asked to fight again in the scorching sands. Our lines of supply are shorter here, and the Commonwealth sees us as hardy colonials suited to hard terrain."
 NZL_operations_pacific:0 "Planning Effort for Pacific"
 NZL_operations_pacific_desc:0 "Our home cannot be neglected. The security of the Pacific has always required any attacker from the North to be delayed until the Royal Navy can muster it's strength."
 # Aviation
 NZL_aviation_effort:0 "An Independent RNZAF"
 NZL_aviation_effort_desc:0 "Airpower will be a dominant force. Our growing air force must be able to evolve independently of the army if we are to take full advantage."
 NZL_light_airframe:0 "Light Airframe Planning"

 NZL_NAV_effort:0 "Air Patrols over the Pacific"
 NZL_NAV_effort_desc:0 "The distances to be covered in the South Pacific are vast, and our naval forces few. Aircraft are an efficient means of keeping watch over the waters to our north."
 # Commonwealth
 NZL_assist_RAF:0 "Transfer Bombers and Crews to RAF"
 NZL_assist_RAF_desc:0 "Where Britain goes, we go. Where she stands, we stand. We have a purchasing option for 30 bombers, with crew training in the UK. Let us offer these to the RAF. Historically the New Zealand Wellington bomber flight then became No.75 (NZ) Squadron RAF."
 NZL_assist_RAF2:0 "Join the BCATP"
 NZL_assist_RAF2_desc:0 "The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan was a massive joint aircrew training program created by the UK, Canada, Australia and NZ. New Zealand went on to provide 2,743 pilots for the RAF during the war."
 NZL_commonwealth_focus:0 "Commonwealth Ties"
 NZL_commonwealth_focus_desc:0 "We are a small trading nation, likely far from the fields of battle. We can best serve the common interest through cooperation with our historic allies."
 NZL_commonwealth_exchanges:0 "Commonwealth Exchanges"
 NZL_commonwealth_exchanges_desc:0 "We can cooperate with our allies, and benefit from our shared wisdom."
 NZL_commonwealth_tech:0 "Technical Assistance"

 NZL_technology_sharing_comm:0 "Commonwealth Mutual Aid"
 NZL_technology_sharing_comm_desc:0 "Great Britain and the Commonwealth appreciate our hard work on behalf of the alliance. Despite the needs of their own armed forces, they offer further technical assistance. Historically NZ received a great deal of aid and lend-lease, most of which was written off after the war."
 NZL_radio_industry:0 "Radio Industry"
 NZL_radio_industry_desc:0 "Our fledgling radio industry is expanding rapidly to cope with our own needs. We can expand further to export additional radios and even radar units to our allies."
 # Singapore
 NZL_singapore_focus:0 "The Singapore Strategy"
 NZL_singapore_focus_desc:0 "From the 1920's our core defence policy has been to rely on Royal Navy assistance, sustained by a fortified naval base. It's status as a symbol of Imperial commitment helped obscure the growing strategic weaknesses in the strategy. Historically New Zealand helped fund the Naval base, which was finished in 1939."
 NZL_singapore_forts:0 "Contribute to Landward Forts"
 NZL_singapore_forts_desc:0 "For better or for worse, work on the grandly-named 'Fortress Singapore' goes slowly. The Singapore Strategy as written requires Australasia to hold on until the Royal Navy can arrive. Contributing to defence works is an option we can choose. Historically the UK started work on ground fortifications, unfinished when invasion occurred."
 # Naval Tree
 NZL_naval_effort:0 "Develop Shipbuilding"
 NZL_naval_effort_desc:0 "Our country has an established, if modest, shipbuilding industry. Historically, shipyard expansion for repairs and the construction of minesweepers and smaller craft occurred from 1940. However, our citizens and policies support industrialisation, and we can focus on shipbuilding now if we so choose."
 NZL_navy_doctrine:0 "Our Place in the World"
 NZL_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "We are a small country dependent on the sea to sell the products of our labour, and receive vital imports. Freedom of the seas is critical for our survival. How or if we go about contributing to this is upto us."

 NZL_minesweepers:0 "Construct Minesweepers"
 NZL_minesweepers_desc:0 "Rearmament has begun, and there is a never-ending demand for escorts and other small ships. We can make plans to construct minesweepers to protect our ports and trade, which will also give our shipbuilders valuable experience."
 NZL_destroyer_effort2:0 "Patrol Craft"
 NZL_destroyer_effort2_desc:0 "Our waters need defenders. We can start planning for the construction of smaller craft on our own initiative. Historically motor launches were constructed that saw service in the island campaigns. In total nearly 500 vessels were constructed during the war, and at least partial repairs done on over 1000 US ships."
 NZL_navy_doctrine2:0 "Form the RNZN"
 NZL_navy_doctrine2_desc:0 "As the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, due to expansion our forces are largely self-sufficient and independent of the Royal Navy. Identifying our navy as our own recognises this fact. Historically this occurred 1 October 1941."
 NZL_cruiser_effort:0 "British Cruiser Designs"
 NZL_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers have long patrolled the South Pacific, being a versatile and balanced ship with adequate range. Perhaps it is time we constructed our own."
 NZL_us_programme:0 "United States Programme"
 NZL_us_programme_desc:0 "The United States has enquired whether our country can construct smaller craft such as tow boats, tugs and powered lighters for the Pacific. We have no steel-workers not already engaged on essential work. However, we can rapidly retrain and supervise carpenters and other trainees, use coachbuilding firms, and bring in steel-workers from the Railway Workshops. Historically over 100 vessels were built."
 # Island Defence
 NZL_fiji_focus:0 "Defence of the Local Islands"
 NZL_fiji_focus_desc:0 "Our means may be limited, but we can still look to our own defence. To the west lies the bulwark of Australia. The most direct threat to our trade and freedom will come from the north. We can build a base in Fiji to help protect our coastal waters."
 NZL_fiji_focus2:0 "Reinforce Fiji"
 NZL_fiji_focus2_desc:0 "We can further develop the installations in our northern neighbour."
 # Look Outside the Commonwealth

 NZL_technology_sharing_desc:0 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime R&D more efficiently."
 NZL_political_effort:0 "Look Beyond the Commonwealth"
 NZL_political_effort_desc:0 "New powers are arising in the Pacific, and Britain is occupied ever-more distantly in Europe. While our ties to Britain may remain, our country's needs may require us to look at other options as well. Historically this occurred during the close cooperation with the US needed during the Pacific campaign, and the reality of a US-dominated Pacific after the end of the war."
 NZL_collectivist_ethos:0 "Collectivist Ethos"

 NZL_deterrence:0 "Deterrence"

 NZL_volunteer_corps:0 "Volunteer Corps"
 NZL_volunteer_corps_desc:0 "Forcing our people to die for ideals of freedom would be an exercise in irony, but establishing means for those who wish to aid people abroad is not."
