 Interwar_AA_tech_desc:0 "While navies had started adding anti-aircraft guns to their ships before the end of the First World War, many navies expanded their investments in naval AA during the 1920s, developing medium-calibre, rapid-firing weapons designed primarily to engage aircraft."
 Late_1930s_AA_tech:0 "Pre-war AA"
 Late_1930s_AA_tech_desc:0 "As aircraft continued to develop, navies in turn refined their AA systems (although the outbreak of war would see that they were insufficient to the task), with higher-velocity, multi-barrelled systems, and early anti-air fire control systems."
 Early_War_AA_tech:0 "Wartime AA expansion"
 Early_War_AA_tech_desc:0 "Wartime experience highlighted the need for greater AA installations on existing and new vessels to counter the threat posed by aircraft."
 Late_War_AA_tech:0 "Advanced AA systems"

 Surface_search_radar:0 "Surface Search Radar"

 air_warning_radar:0 "Air Warning Radar"
 air_warning_radar_desc:0 "As radar sets were refined, they were employed to provide early warning of air attack. In effect, this enabled vessels to be ready for the aircraft and put up a stronger air defence."
 advanced_surface_search_radar:0 "Advanced Surface Search Radar"
 advanced_surface_search_radar_desc:0 "The development of centimetric radar allowed the installation of far more powerful but also far smaller radar sets.  This meant larger vessels had even more tactical awareness, and smaller vessels were able to employ radar as well."
 surface_fc_radar:0 "Surface Fire Control Radar"
 surface_fc_radar_desc:0 "It wasn't long before radar was being used to assist with fire control and ranging, making larger warships more effective at range and at night."

 depth_charge_throwers_desc:0 "The main weapon against submarines in the inter-war period and for most of the Second World War was the depth charge.
