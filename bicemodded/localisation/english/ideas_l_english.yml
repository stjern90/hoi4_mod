 IRE_trade_war_desc:0 "On taking over power and coming into office in 1932, the new Fianna Fáil government under Éamon de Valera embarked upon a protectionist policy in economic dealings, and tariffs were introduced for a wide range of imported goods, mainly from Britain, the Free State's largest trading partner by far. This was thought necessary to develop native industry, move away from over-dependence on Britain, as well as its failure to develop industrially under free market conditions. It was also to compensate for the drastic fall in demand for Irish agricultural products on international markets, due to the Great Depression which had begun in 1929. Other means had also to be found to help the disastrously undermined balance of trade and the mounting national debt. A vigorous campaign was set in motion to make the Free State agriculturally and industrially self-sufficient by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Seán Lemass. Every effort was taken to add to the measures brought in by the previous government to boost tillage farming and industry and to encourage the population to avoid British imports and 'Buy Irish Goods'."

 IRE_trade_war_eng_desc:0 "British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald retaliated with the imposition of 20% import duty on Free State agricultural products into the UK, which constituted 90% of all Free State exports. UK households were unwilling to pay twenty percent extra for these food products. The Free State responded in kind by placing a similar duty on British imports and in the case of coal from the UK, with the remarkable slogan (from Jonathan Swift in the 1720s): 'Burn everything English except their coal'. While the UK was much less affected by the ensuing Economic War, the Irish economy was badly affected.

Like other countries around the globe, France has been deeply affected by the crash of the stock market in 1929. Even if we managed to avoid the worst of the depression, the effects of the crisis still prove to be catastrophic for the economy. In a time where the populace is starting to shift to the §RFar-left§! and §YFar-right§! parties, the French political establishment has decided that deep §YEconomic reform§! is the best course of action. The government will intervene in the crucial sectors of the industry and agriculture to safeguard the interests of workers and investors and create new institutions to regulate the market and collect money to protect the poorest levels of society. But the biggest challenge will be implementing budget cuts not only in unproductive areas of the state but also cutting the huge salaries of bureaucrats and politicians. France is at the brink of ruin, and only a swift decisive action will save it from the jaws of fascism."

This plan anticipated for more than 40 years a concept, modified and updated, would become reality under the direction of Eliezer Batista, in the 1960s, with the opening of the Port of Tubarão. Percival Farquhar failed success. Although he could count on the sympathy of President Pessoa, who gave him a concession known as Itabira Agreement 1920, Farquhar found fierce opposition to his project, including the governor of the state of Minas Gerais (then almost autonomous), Artur Bernardes, who then elect the president. Decades of heated debate followed, with the country practically divided between supporters of the two positions without the Farquhar project leave the drawing board. This plan was made impossible when Getúlio Vargas took power at the head of the Revolution of 1930 and took over the iron reserves that belonged to Farquhar, creating with them in 1942, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, as a state company, for which obtained the approval of the United States and England in the Washington Accords.

After the coup, Vargas closed the Congress and imposed a new constitution (dubbed the "Polish") with various anti-democratic features. "Let us restore the nation in its authority and freedom of action: in his authority, giving you the tools for real and effective power that can override the disruptive influences, internal or external, in their freedom, opening the plenary session of the national trial about the means and ends of government and letting it freely build your history and your destiny -.

In January 1942 President Getulio Vargas and Minister Alexandre Marcondes Filho work exchanged the first ideas about the need to do a consolidation of labor laws. The primary idea was to create the "Consolidation of the Laws of Labour and Social Security. Were invited to be part of the contract Joseph's Segadas Viana lawyers, Oscar Saraiva, Luis Augusto Rego Monteiro, Dorval Lacerda Marcondes and Arnaldo Lopes Süssekind. At the first meeting it was decided that the committee would be divided into Labor and Welfare and two different consolidations would be created. Material sources of CLT were, first, the conclusions of the 1st Brazilian Congress of Social Law, held in May 1941 in São Paulo, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum, organized by Professor Cesarino Junior and the lawyer Rui Azevedo Sodre. The second source was the international labor conventions. The third was the very Encyclical Rerum Novarum and finally the opinions of legal advisers Vianna and Oscar Saraiva, approved by the Minister of Labour. In November 1942, he was presented the draft of the Labor Code, subsequently published in the Official Gazette for suggestions. After studying the project, Getúlio Vargas gave the co-authors and appointing them to examine the suggestions and write the final project finally signed on May 1, 1943. CLT is called the Consolidation of Labor Laws, instead of Code of Labor Laws because their goal was just to gather the sparse labor law existing at the time, consolidating it. Hence its name. I could not receive the name "Code" because it is not a new law, only a consolidator meeting. It is also clear that a law will be called "Code" when the legal provisions in the legislative text are voted on one by one and simultaneously by Congress. This means that should be voted article by article."

Under considerable middle class pressure, a more activist, centralized state adapted to represent the interests that the new bourgeoisie had been demanded for years — one that could utilize a state interventionist policy consisting of tax breaks, lowered duties, and import quotas to expand the domestic capital base. Manufacturers, white-collar workers, and the urban proletariat alike had earlier enjoyed the respite of world trade associated with World War I. However, the coffee oligarchs, relying on a devolved power structure relegating power to their own patrimonial ruling oligarchies, were certainly not interested in regularizing Brazil's personalistic politics or centralizing power.

Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. A variety of methods are employed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level. It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Politics and the works of Confucius. Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures.

Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are eligible, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election.

A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808, when the Portuguese Prince regent, later King Dom João VI, fled from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. João VI later returned to Portugal, leaving his eldest son and heir, Pedro, to rule the Kingdom of Brazil as regent. On 7 September 1822, Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and, after waging a successful war against his father's kingdom, was acclaimed on 12 October as Pedro I, the first Emperor of Brazil. The new country was huge but sparsely populated and ethnically diverse. Unlike most of the neighboring Hispanic American republics, Brazil had political stability, vibrant economic growth, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech, and respect for civil rights of its subjects, albeit with legal restrictions on women and slaves, the latter regarded as property and not citizens. The empire's bicameral parliament was elected under comparatively democratic methods for the era, as were the provincial and local legislatures. This led to a long ideological conflict between Pedro I and a sizable parliamentary faction over the role of the monarch in the government. He faced other obstacles. The unsuccessful Cisplatine War against the neighboring United Provinces of the Río de la Plata in 1828 led to the secession of the province of Cisplatina (later to become Uruguay). In 1826, despite his role in Brazilian independence, he became the king of Portugal; he immediately abdicated in favor of his eldest daughter. Two years later, her throne was usurped by Pedro I's younger brother. Unable to deal with both Brazilian and Portuguese affairs, Pedro I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and immediately departed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.(You are a constitutional monarchy, the Head of State will be the Emperor but Prime Ministers will be elected in the background every 4 years)"

The coup that ended the monarchy in Brazil in 1889 was not well accepted by the personnel of the Armada. Imperial Mariners were attacked when they tried to support the imprisoned Emperor in the City Palace.

An important instrument of this policy was the use of foreign exchange controls to protect selected segments of domestic industry and to facilitate the importation of equipment and inputs for them. However, the move to fixed exchange rates together with import licensing drastically curtailed exports, and the balance of payments problem became acute. The system became nearly unmanageable, and in 1953 a more flexible, multiple-exchange-rate system was introduced. Under the latter, imports considered essential were brought in at a favored rate; imports of goods that could be supplied domestically faced high rates and were allotted small portions of the available foreign exchange. Similarly, some exports were stimulated with a higher exchange rate than those of traditional exports. This system continued to be the main instrument for the promotion of import substitution industrialization, but the performance of the export sector improved only modestly."
 fria_indu_iii:0 "Industrial Expansion III"
 fria_indu_iii_desc:0 "In the second half of the 1950s, the government enacted a series of special programs intended to better orient the industrialization process, to remove bottlenecks, and to promote vertical integration in certain industries.

 fria_indu_iv:0 "Industrial Expansion IV"
 fria_indu_iv_desc:0 "Between 1957 and 1961, the government made several changes in the exchange-control system, most of which were attempts at reducing its awkwardness or at improving its performance with the advance of import substitution industrialization. For this same purpose, the government also introduced several complementary measures, including enacting the Tariff Law of 1957, increasing and solidifying the protection extended to domestic industries, and offering strong inducements to direct foreign investment."

Between 1950 and 1961, the average annual rate of growth of the gross domestic product exceeded 7%. Industry was the engine of growth. It had an average annual growth rate of over 9 percent between 1950 and 1961, compared with 4.5% for agriculture. In addition, the structure of the manufacturing sector experienced considerable change.

By the 1880s the Brazilian Imperial Navy was the most powerful in South America. After the 1893 naval rebellion, there was a hiatus in the development of the navy until 1905, when Brazil acquired two of the most powerful and advanced dreadnoughts of the day which sparked dreadnought race with Brazil's South American neighbours.

Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the armored cruisers for reasons of cost, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three small battleships on 23 July 1906. British shipyards were ordered to build two dreadnought battleships, Minas Gerais and São Paulo; this started a naval arms race with Argentina and Chile.

But local fishermen complained that large boats were coming from France to catch lobster off the state of Pernambuco, so the Brazilian Admiral Arnoldo Toscano ordered two corvettes to sail to the area where the French fishing boats were located. Seeing that the fishermen's claim was justifiable, the captain of the Brazilian vessel then demanded that the French boats receded to deeper water, leaving the continental shelf to smaller Brazilian vessels. The situation became very tense once the French rejected this demand and radioed a message asking for the French government to send a destroyer to accompany the lobster boats, which prompted the Brazilian government to put its many ships on state of alert. French Government dispatched on 21 February the T 53-class destroyer to watch over the fishing boats, but it was promptly repelled by a Brazilian warship and the aircraft carrier Minas Gerais."

Rather than accuse me, they insult me; they do not fight me, they vilify me and do not allow me the right to defend myself. They must drown my voice and impede my actions so that I shall not continue to defend the people as I always have, especially the humble. I follow my destiny. After decades of domination and plunder by international economic and financial groups, I placed myself at the head of a revolution and won. I began the work of liberation and I restored a regime of social freedom. I had to resign. I returned to the Government on the shoulders of the people. The underground campaign of international groups allied with rebellious national groups that opposed the program of guaranteed employment. The extraordinary profits law was held up in Congress. Hatred was unleashed against the just revision of the minimum wage. The potentialization of our resources through Petrobrás would create national freedom; this had hardly begun to operate when the wave of agitation swelled. Eletrobrás was obstructed to the point of desperation. They do not want the worker to be free. They do not want the people to be independent. I assumed the Government in the midst of an inflationary spiral which was destroying the value of work. Profits for foreign companies were reaching as much as 500 percent per year. In declaration of import values, evidence showed frauds of more than $100 million per year. With the coffee crisis, our main product increased in value. We tried to defend the price, and the response was violent pressure on our economy until we were obliged to yield. I have fought month by month, day by day, hour by hour, in resistance to constant, incessant pressure, bearing everything in silence, forgetting everything, yielding myself in order to defend the people who, if I fail, are abandoned. There is nothing more I can give you except my blood. If the birds of prey want someone's blood, if they want to go on draining the Brazilian people, I offer my life as the holocaust. I choose this way to be always with you. When they humiliate you, you will feel my soul suffering by your side. When hunger knocks at your door, you will feel in your breast the energy to fight for yourselves and for your children. When you are slandered, my memory will give you the strength to respond. My sacrifice will keep you united and my name will be your fighting flag. Each drop of my blood will be an immortal flame in your conscience and will maintain the sacred will to resist. To hatred I reply with pardon. And to those who think they have defeated me, I reply with my victory. I was a slave to the people, and today I free myself for eternal life. But this people, to whom I was slave, will no longer be slave to anyone. My sacrifice will be forever in its soul and my blood will be the price of its ransom. I fought against the exploitation of Brazil. I fought against the exploitation of the people. I have fought with my whole heart. Hatred, infamy and slander have not conquered my spirit. I gave my life to you. Now I offer you my death. I fear nothing. Calmly I take the first step toward eternity and leave life to enter History." - Getulio Vargas"
