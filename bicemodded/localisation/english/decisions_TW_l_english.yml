Despite this, Italy was awarded the territory in the settlement drawn up by the great powers. It was concluded that giving Italy territory posed no risk to anyone. Since its creation, the colony is in a constant state of insurgency from the native Libian tribesmen, primarily led by the Islamic "Senussi Order". The insurgents were dealt a massive defeat in 1932 and stability has begun to return, with many Italian settlers migrating to colonise the lands, often called the "Fourth Shore".

The Frontier Wire - a barbed wire fence - was built from the Mediterranean to the oasis of Al-Jaghbub to sever lines critical to the resistance. Soon afterwards, the colonial administration began the wholesale deportation of the people of the Jebel Akhdar to deny the rebels the support of the local population. The forced migration of more than 100,000 people ended in internment camps in Suluq, El Magrun, Abyar and El Agheila where tens of thousands died in squalid conditions."

To exploit this victory, the Soviet general staff planned a winter campaign of continuous and highly ambitious offensive operations, codenamed "Saturn". Later Joseph Stalin reduced his ambitious plans to a relatively small campaign codenamed "Operation Little Saturn". The offensive succeeded in smashing Germany's Italian and Hungarian allies, applied pressure on the over stretched German forces in Eastern Ukraine and prevented further German advances to the relief of the entrapped forces at Stalingrad. Despite these victories, the Soviets themselves became over extended, setting up the stages for the German offensives of the Third Battle of Kharkov and the Battle of Kursk."
