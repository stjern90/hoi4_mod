 startevent.10.t:0 "Combined Arms"
 startevent.10.d:0 "In this mod, line and support companies are more specialized in a way that encourages players to design historic combined-arms divisions. Divisions containing only one type of unit will suffer certain disadvantages and the most balanced and diverse will be the best divisions. Together with the more obvious stats there are synergies with other game mechanics such as modified combat tactic chances based on division types.\n\nOnly the 'main' infantry frontline units provide a healthy portion of the most vital stat: Hitpoints ( all are added together ) and Organization and Morale ( as an average value of the whole division). Tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles add a lower Hitpoint count and have a lot less Organization. Most specialized support units ( except for HQ and Signal units ) degrade Organization and only provide a small measure of Hitpoints but of course excel in their field and allow for combined arms bonuses and/or different terrain modifiers.\n\nPlease note that support units give their bonuses to the whole division and some line units stats ( such as Terrain modifiers, Piercing, Armour etc.) are averaged out depending on type and number of battalions."

 startevent.11.t:0 "Artillery"
 startevent.11.d:0 "Artillery is THE main counter against fortifications ( beside strategic bombers ) and increase your firepower against soft targets. TW has a lot of fortifications wherever it made sense historically and/or to emphasize the natural defense of certain key locations in addition to terrain. The heavier the artillery piece the better it is vs. fortifications and cities. The smaller it is, the more cost effective regarding firepower it is.\n\nThe basic artillery unit is horse drawn and slow, you can improve that by using - expensive - motorized artillery units. Keep in mind that the division is only as fast as the slowest line battalion ( exception: Siege artillery - which is a support battalion but gives large movement maluses to the division, so whatever template you use - a siege division will be slow ).\n\nPack Artillery is the only air droppable artillery unit and quite useful in difficult terrain or amphibious invasions, larger artillery units tend to be less flexible.\n\nSelf propelled artillery usually follows the rules regarding light/medium/heavy artillery but also provides armour and speed and many obsolete tank chassis were reused as artillery carriers.\n\nA nation will need to carefully contemplate its artillery needs versus its industrial resources, organizational drawbacks and potential enemies. A few expensive siege divisions may provide a crucial breakthrough through an otherwise unassailable position but may be useless in regular battles."
 
 startevent.12.t:0 "Armour/Hardness/Penetration"
 startevent.12.d:0 "Whenever the average armour value of your division is higher than the penetrating value of the enemy division, incoming damage is reduced by 30% vs. Strength and Org. If the enemy is able to pierce your divisions armour it is simply neutralized and neither one gains any advantage. \n\nPenetrating value is partly an average of all the components in your division and a percentage of your highest penetration value added together. So a single high performance AT unit really helps for penetration more than a few low ones. The same principle applies to armour.\n\nThe hardness of your division is very important and has a huge effect. It determines how many soft and hard attacks you actually receive. A hardness of 70% means that you receive 30% of the enemies soft attack and 70% of its hard attack. So if an enemy division has a very high soft attack of 200 and a very low hard attack value of 10 your panzerdivision will only receive 67 damage dice ( 200 x 0,3 + 10 x 0,7 ), while a pure infantry unit would receive 200 damage dice. \n\nIn addition Tanks and Assault guns usually have high breakthrough values which help reducing damage when on the attack. The infantry ( and especially low quality units) is usually very vulnerable while attacking, unless you provide some armoured support or transport vehicles. For details see the CombatWidth/Breakthrough/Defense chapter."
 
 startevent.13.t:0 "Supply & Stacking"
 startevent.13.d:0 "In this mod every front line battalion has a stacking multiplier that incrementally increases a supply penalty for the whole division, this makes each extra battalion that much more costly and WILL limit you to about a max width of 30 ( 30 width is very situational and will not work in most cases, 20 width is the most universal)\n\nThe logistics companies play a vital role in countering the multiplier, you should use one of the 4 different logistics companies that you can afford.\n\nThe logistics companies are tiered from 1 to 4 they go up in cost and effectiveness, starting with the small logistics company, then moving onto the horse-drawn, and the semi motorized. Finally finishing with the highest tier motorised logistics, Keep in mind the last two levels will use trucks and thus fuel.\n\nIf you plan offensives with large division or armour, motorised logistics is preferable. Don't underestimate the need for up-to-date logistics techs, penalties are a lot harsher than vanilla. \n\nImprove Infrastructure and ports for better supply in zones and be sure to check the supply map mode for bottlenecks."
 
 startevent.14.t:0 "Combat width/Breakthrough/Defence"
 startevent.14.d:0 "Whenever a division is the attacker it uses its “Breakthrough” value to avoid enemy attacks, being on defensive uses the “Defence” value ( duh ). Each point of attack uses up one point of BT/DEF. \n\nThe attacks that you are protected from deal 55% less damage , unprotected attacks deal full damage. \n\nThe base combat width is 120 and each extra attack from another enemy province provides an additional 60 width. Suggested optimal widths should therefore ideally be : 15, 20, 24, 30.\n\nRead the Supply & Stacking chapter for further understanding of what limits the maximum width in this mod."

 startevent.15.t:0 "Tips and tricks"
 startevent.15.d:0 "To get the best result the keyword is combined arms. You will need to utilize your airplanes in conjunction with your land forces to overwhelm the enemy, attacking is hard!\n\nThe combined arms aspect in your land units is even more important, here is a shortlist what some battalions are most effective at providing:\n\nLarger Artillery pieces: Largest Fort/Urban attack bonus, some soft attack. Smaller artillery pieces: Some Fort/Urban attack bonus, Largest soft attack. Artillery in general: minor attack bonuses in all terrain, slows down your division, 0 or negative organization!\n\nA-T and T-Ds: Largest hard attack and piercing. Assault guns: Largest breakthrough, high armour and hardness. Tanks: Largest armour and hardness, high HP, high breakthrough, high piercing and medium attacks. \n\nAA: only units that provide anti air stat. Heavy AA also provides a high piercing. \n\nHigh manpower units(inf, mot, mount, marines, mech, militia etc..): Largest HP and defense, high organization and morale. \n\nAlso note that SS units are considered special forces, they are about 10% stronger and more expensive than their normal counterparts and provide slight bonuses in urban, river and fort terrain. The SS units are one of Germany's strongest assets later in the game, they will provide your veteran warriors with the tools they need!"
 
 startevent.16.t:0 "Trade and Economy"
 startevent.16.d:0 "The scale of the economy has been increased a lot to so even small countries will trade in the global economy. You will have to trade a lot of resources and plan for the economy after your trade convoys are threatened. Factory output was lowered and factory numbers were increased as described in Equipment section. \n\nChromium was replaced by Rare Materials representing various key resources in this mod and not just chromium, this also applies to tungsten to some extent.\n\nInvest early and sufficiently in oil and rubber industries, as well as storage capacities, when it is forseeable that you will be cut of from trade at some point. Large shortages will cripple your production and without fuel your armies will grind to a halt.\n\nAt some point in the war global resource shortages will hit everybody and will cause deficits. Germany and especially Japan will suffer from embargoes as soon as political tensions rise."
 
 startevent.18.t:0 "Suggested Builds"
 startevent.18.d:0 "A common question is about suggested builds, but its hard to to give a definite answer. Mostly used are 20-width builds with like 8 Infantry & 4 L.Artillery, also 24 width builds are common. \n\nRemember that without anti air and anti tank your division will be slaughtered if you encounter large tank units or heavy air cover. Anti air ( especially heavy anti air ) will also provide some penetration capability for your division but the latest anti tank units provide more hard attacks ( penetration doesnt help much if you have only a few hard attacks ).\n\nSupply is crucial and to avoid overcrowding of front lines try to minimize supply demands of your divisions."
 
 startevent.19.t:0 "Navy"
 startevent.19.d:0 "Carriers, battleships, battlecruisers and heavy cruisers are capital ships providing long range firepower, while escort ships such as light cruisers and destroyers screen capitals from hostile fire and torpedos. Submarines are split into light and heavy hulls, the main difference being, that light submarines tend to be short range coastal raiders and heavy submarines can be outfitted to be long range patrol ships. Light submarines are not less capable than heavies rather they simply have shorter range and are less likely to be spotted than heavy submarines. Submarines on normal orders are expected to kill unescorted convoys. Try to avoid heavily escorted shipping lanes to avoid heavy loses. Respectively, guard your convoys from enemy raiders. \n\nDue to the complexities of naval coordination, the size of fleets plays a large role. The larger your fleet, the worse it will perform against smaller, better coordinated opponents due to the fleet size penalty. Consequently, putting a lot of ships together is not always the best idea. For raiding, patrolling and escorting you may want to use smaller fleets, while larger stack(s) will also be needed. Combat is also significantly slowed, with damage applied lowered across the board. Because of this, a naval campaign will be more attritional and theaters more rarely decided by one climactic battle.\n\nTemplates can ensure each fleet is replenished from its reserves automatically by clicking the destination button in the production tab and moving newly built ships into "Reserve." Designs can be optimized to your most recent technology by using "Auto" option in the ship design page. To find the particular hull you wish to modify, use ship hull filters in the production screen. \n\nDestroyers are cheap enough to fulfill most roles in your navy, ranging from ASW to screening in pitched battles. Therefore, you will most likely wish to center your fleets (and your strategy) around the efficient construction and use of them. However, with their low survivability you should consider adding a cruiser to even small Destroyer formations."
 
 startevent.20.t:0 "Equipment"
 startevent.20.d:0 "Division spam hampers performance of vanilla especially later in the war, so TW tries to eliminate spam with limits to AI building and equipment being relatively expensive. You will have more factories than vanilla, so that even small countries can have a diverse production, but they have less output each. \n\nCertain techs like Motorization ( replaces horses with vehicles ), some Doctrines and Radio techs will change ( adds or subtracts ) the Equipment demand of existing divisions and templates. In order to get the full bonuses you will need to produce enough of the equipment for the changed needs. Remember to plan ahead, Units with less than 100% Equipment will have worse stats than complete ones and major refits shortly before or during wars can cripple your army."

 italy.401:0 "The P-26/40 tank"
 italy.401.t:0 "The Pesante P-26/40 medium tank"
 italy.401.d:0 "The P40 was an Italian medium tank design. It was armed with a 75 mm gun and an 8 mm Breda machine gun, plus another optional machine gun in an anti-aircraft mount. The official Italian designation was Carro Armato P 26/40. (P for pesante ("heavy")), the weight of 26 tons, and the year of adoption 1940 ( the same year design started).\nAlthough designed in 1940, the first prototype was not completed until 1942 due to the unavailability and very slow development of a suitable engine. For the production model a 330 HP engine was used and in the end a 420 HP petrol engine was eventually tested.\nThe design of the P40 was originally similar to tanks such as the M11/39, but with a bigger 75mm L34 cannon. This weapon had a muzzle velocity of around 700 m/s. Secondary armament were 2 machine guns. After learning about Soviet T-34s in 1941, the armour of the P40 was quickly re-designed, adopting more markedly sloped, thicker plates. The main role of the P40 shifted from infantry support to anti-tank warfare, and all the internal space was dedicated to this end, making the vehicle rather cramped.\nThe turret was operated by two crew members and this was a significant drawback as it put excessive workload on the tank's commander. At that time, most new tanks were designed with three-man turrets, following the successful example of the German Panzer III (commander/loader/gunner in turret).\nThe mechanical systems were a development of the "M" series, in particular the suspension which was reliable, but in rough terrain would not allow speeds similar to the more modern Christie suspension or torsion bar suspension. Nevertheless, the good power-to-weight ratio represented a significant improvement in mobility over its predecessors.\nThe armour, quite resistant by Italian standards, was sloped at 45° and 50mm at the front and 60 mm thick at the turret front and mantlet (by comparison the M13/40 had 42 mm), but it was still riveted at a time when most tanks were constructed by welding. Compared to welded armour, riveted armour is vulnerable to breaking apart at the joints so that even impenetrable plates can be ripped off by rivet failures.\nThe P40 design was reasonably up-to-date, but the tank was without some modern features such as welded armour, adequate suspension, and a cupola for the commander. The P40 was designated as a heavy tank in Italy, but its weight, armour and armament would classify it as medium tank in Wehrmacht or other contemporary armies. Despite its shortcomings, the P40 was the only Italian tank design that was comparable to Allied and German medium tanks as they appeared in the middle of the war.\nOf the 1,200 tanks ordered, only a few (between one and five depending on the source) pre-production models were completed before the Italian Armistice in September 1943, at which point they were taken over by the German Wehrmacht."

 italy.402.d:0 "Italian tank designers had focused on the needs of the army for a tank suitable for mountain warfare as well as for colonial use rather than one meant to fight contemporary European vehicles. As a result, the production of their first modern gun-armed tank was slow in coming. The Italians had evaluated and done some experiments with some other European tanks,  all leading up to the design which became the M.11/39.\nIn 1936, the Italian Army issued requirements for a tank with a 3 man crew, a 37mm L.40 gun mounted in the hull and two 8mm machine guns in the turret. As it would not be fighting tanks, the vehicle only needed armour to be proof against armour piercing ammunition from small arms and 20mm cannon fire. This new vehicle was set to replace the very outdated Fiat 3000’s the Italian Army  was still operating along with the CV.3 light tanks. \nAn initial prototype was made in 1936 but was abandoned in 1937. The essential layout and suspension design of the prototype were retained though for development of a new 10-ton tank. Despite it being obvious for years that tanks armed with cannons rather than machine guns were needed, it was not until May 1938 that the Italian Army officially decided that gun-armed tanks were going to be essential to its new armoured division makeup despite years of experimental development beforehand. This vehicle was ideal for what the Army wanted from a medium tank, a pair of machine guns mounted in a turret and a 37mm gun or 47mm gun mounted in the hull, and capable of 30-35kph. It had grown a little heavier than the original 10 tonnes though and was now an 11 tonne vehicle and was given the name M.11/39 (Medium, 11 tonnes, 1939)."

 italy.403.t:0 "The Carro Armato M13/40 medium tank"
 italy.403.d:0 "The specification for the M13/40 was first issued in December 1937 by the Regio Esercito. It was intended as a replacement for older models, namely the FIAT L3 tankettes and the medium M11/39, an interim tank with a hull main gun. It was accepted in service after some changes and production set-up in March 1940. The entire lower hull of the former M11/39 was kept unchanged, except for some details in the fixations of the bogies and idler. The suspension still consisted of two bogies per side, each with semi elliptic leaf springs, and each with a twin set of road wheels, which were bigger than on the M11/39. Because of the relatively high production numbers, nearly all Italian armoured divisions received large amounts of these tanks, which replaced older models. First engagements came with the Albanian and Greek campaigns in late 1940, and of course the North African campaign, where most soldiered until 1943. Their first engagement in the desert campaign was with the Babini Brigade in December 1940, during operation Compass. The M13/40 had undeniably good characteristics, including relative ease of production, a sober diesel engine and an efficient gun. It was capable of piercing 45 mm of armour at 500 m, with an effective HE round and good secondary firepower. It could disable most British light, medium and cruiser tanks until 1942, but was harmless against British infantry tanks, like the Matilda and Valentine. The bolted hull presented a danger for the crew at every impact, and the hull plates had a tendency to crack. Plus, the mechanical parts and the engine itself proved unreliable on the long run. The speed was below-average in proportion to the weight. All of this, combined with a simplistic construction and a higher vulnerable to artillery fire, made the M13/40 obsolete by the beginning of 1942. However its conversion to the Semovente type assault guns prolonged the chassis usefulness for a few years more."

Historically, the British launched a counter-invasion in January 1941 and the Italians went on the defensive in East Africa. The Italians fought throughout February. But, after fierce resistance, the Battle of Keren ended in Italian defeat, after which the rest of Eritrea, including the port of Massawa, fell quickly. With supplies running low and with no chance of re-supply, the Duke of Aosta opted to concentrate the remaining Italian forces into several strongholds: Gondar, Amba Alagi, Dessie, and Gimma. He himself commanded the 7,000 Italians at the mountain fortress of Amba Alagi. With his water supply compromised, surrounded, and besieged by 9,000 British and Commonwealth troops and more than 20,000 Ethiopian irregulars, the Duke of Aosta surrendered Amba Alagi on 18 May 1941. Due to the gallant resistance of the Italian garrison, the British allowed them to surrender with honours of war. Shortly after his surrender, the Duke of Aosta was interned in a prisoner-of-war camp in Nairobi, Kenya. He was placed in command of his fellow prisoners, but never saw the end of World War II. On 3 March 1942, shortly after his internment, he died at the prison camp, reportedly as a result of complications from both tuberculosis and malaria."

The acceptance of the ultimatum meant the loss of the statehood. After a rigged election with only a communist party attending, the country was officially a communist state. At its first meeting on 21 July 1940, the new Parliament declared that Lithuania had expressed its will to become part of the USSR. Resolutions to effectuate the country's sovietisation were made the very same day. On 3 August, a Lithuanian delegation of prominent public figures was dispatched to Moscow to sign the document of Lithuania's accession to the USSR.

The occupation was a complete surprise, which resulted in its being quick and bloodless. The initial plan was to immobilise the Hungarian army, but with Soviet forces advancing from the north and east, and with the prospect of British and American forces invading the Balkans, the German military decided to retain Hungarian forces in the field, sending a portion to defend the passes through the Carpathians against possible invasion."

The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire "shooting party" was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages.

In April 1942 a plebiscite was held on the question, "Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligations arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service?"\n\nThe plebiscite was supported by most English Canadians as well as the banned Communist Party of Canada which established Tim Buck "Yes" Committees to campaign for a yes vote. Across Canada, 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Even in Toronto, a strongly pro-conscription region, Conservative Arthur Meighen was defeated in a by-election after promising to help introduce conscription."

A 1000 HP Diamler-Benz Schnellbootsmotor from an E-boat would propel the tank to an estimated 44 km/h. Krupp, which had lost out on the Panther program, was ordered to develop this new tank, not exceeding 90 tons. In January of 1942, Krupp revealed their design, armed with a 105mm KwK L/70 cannon. At this point, the engine was changed to Maybach’s new 800hp HL 230. Many different designs were proposed and drawn up during the Löwe’s development; some had the turret in the front, some had the turret in the middle, and some placed the turret at the rear. Some designs were given a 150mm gun, while most used a 105mm gun.\n\nIn February 1942 WaffenPrüfamt.6 ordered two tanks (one with a turret, one with a test weight) of 72 tons to be built and for series production to begin as soon as possible. These tanks were to be 72 tons as the railcars used for the Tiger could carry this amount of weight. They would share the Tiger’s drive train and armor layout as well (100mm at the front, 80mm at the sides)and had the long barrelled 105mm L/70 gun.

This marked the change from pure infantry support vehicle to a cheap, multi-purpose assault gun/tank destroyer producible in large numbers. Firing armour-piercing Panzergranat-Patrone 39, the StuK 40 L/43 could penetrate 91 mm of armour inclined 30 degrees from vertical at 500 m, 82 mm at 1,000 m, 72 mm at 1,500 m, 63 mm at 2,000 m, allowing the Ausf. F to engage most Soviet armoured vehicles at normal combat ranges. This change marked the StuG as being more of a tank destroyer than an infantry support vehicle. An exhaust fan was added to the rooftop to evacuate fumes from spent shells, to enable the firing of continuous shots. Additional 30 mm armour plates were welded to the 50 mm frontal armour from June 1942, making the frontal armour 80 mm thick. From June 1942, Ausf. F were mounted with longer 75 mm StuK 40 L/48 gun.

When Germany seized the industrial jewels of Czechoslovakia prior to the war, it also acquired a treasure of tank manufacturing skills that was to provide more than 5,000 extremely reliable tanks during the war. The whole family was derived from a single model: the Škoda/Praga Lt vz.38, or Panzer 38(t), a light tank which was used until 1943-44, but also gave birth to one of the most prolific German tank hunters of the war, the Jagdpanzer 38(t) or, as it is commonly known today, the Hetzer. Among the early inspiration sources for the casemate shape and light tank accommodation, the Romanian Mareșal ( based on captured Russian T-60 chassis ) is often cited. Although the development of the Mareșal and the Hetzer advanced in parallel in 1943 (it was even estimated that common production would take place in the future), the Germans were quick to have a finished prototype ready for production. The first wooden mock-up was ready in January 1944, presented and accepted by the Waffenamt, the first production Hetzer was made in March 1944. A decision was made to mount the 75 mm Pak 39, shared with the early versions of the Jagdpanzer IV. Despite its appearance, the Hetzer was not built directly over the Panzer 38(t) chassis. The latter had to be widened and lengthened in order to support the weight of the casemate, and had modified suspensions with an up-rated engine. The engine was the new 160 HP Praga AC/2 6-cylinder and along with the reinforced suspension, compensated for the overall weight increase, which went from 9,5 tons on the original light tank to the 15,7 tons of a Hetzer in battle order. Top speed was apparently still 42 km/h, which appears optimistic, since the power to weight ratio fell to only 10 HP/ton, compared to 13.15 HP/ton on the Panzer 38(t). Cross-country speed was probably no more than 15 km/h at best, like the model it was based on. It was far short from the original specifications. In terms of protection, the big advantage of the Hetzer was its highly sloped casemate, with a 60 mm thick plate sloped 60°from the vertical, and therefore offered around 120 mm of effective protection. The sides were only 20 mm thick - inclined at 40° - and made of low quality alloy, barely able to stop anti-tank-rifles."

 germany.398.d:0 "The Panzer III is the common name used for a family of German medium tanks used from the beginning of the War. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen III (abbreviated PzKpfw III). On January 11, 1934, following specifications laid down by Heinz Guderian, the Army Weapons Department drew up plans for a medium tank with a maximum weight of 24 tons, 15mm of armour (later up to 50+20mm) and a top speed of 35 km/h. It was intended as the main tank of the German Panzer divisions, capable of engaging and destroying opposing tank forces, and was to be paired with the Panzer IV, which was to fulfil the second use: dealing with anti-tank guns and infantry strong points, such as machine-gun nests, firing high-explosive shells at such soft targets. Such supportive tanks designed to operate with friendly infantry against the enemy generally were heavier and carried more armour. Initially in its antitank role it was armed with a 37mm/L46,5 gun which was upgraded to a short barrelled 50mm/L42 and later to a long barrelled 50mm/L60 gun. However, as the Germans faced the formidable T-34, more powerful anti-tank guns were needed, and since the Panzer IV had more development potential with a larger turret ring, it was redesigned to mount the long-barrelled 75mm KwK 40 gun. The Panzer III effectively swapped roles with the Panzer IV, as from 1942 the last version of Panzer III mounted the 75mm/L24 KwK 37 that was better suited for infantry support. It also provided the basis for numerous special vehicles like flame tanks and amphibious tanks. Production of the Panzer III ceased in 1943. Nevertheless, the Panzer III's capable chassis provided hulls for the Sturmgeschütz III assault gun until the end of the war. "

 germany.399.d:0 "The Panzer II is the common name used for a family of German light tanks used early in the War. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen II (abbreviated PzKpfw II). Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while larger, more advanced tanks were developed, it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II, during the Polish and French campaigns. The Panzer II was the most numerous tank in the German Panzer divisions at the beginning of the war. The Panzer II was supplanted by the Panzer III and IV medium tanks by 1940/1941. By the end of 1942, it had been largely removed from front line service and it was used for training and on secondary fronts. The turrets of the then-obsolete Panzer Is and Panzer IIs were reused as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers, particularly on the Atlantic Wall. Production of the tank itself ceased by January 1944, but its chassis remained in use as the basis of several other armoured vehicles, chiefly self-propelled artillery and tank destroyers such as the Wespe and Marder II respectively. The Panzer II was designed before the experience of the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39 showed that protection against armour-piercing shells was required for tanks to survive on a modern battlefield. Prior to that, armour was designed only to stop machine gun fire and high-explosive shell fragments. The Panzer II Ausf. A to C had 14 mm of slightly sloped homogeneous steel armour on the sides, front, and back. Most of them were later given increased armour in the front of the vehicle, most noticeable by the changed appearance of the front hull from rounded to boxy shape. Starting with the D model, the front armour was increased to 30 mm. The Model F had 35 mm front armour and 20 mm side armour. This level of protection was still only proof against small arms fire. Apart from unsuccessful attempts with Pz.II M replacing the turret with a larger, open-topped turret containing a 5 cm KwK 39/1 gun, all turreted versions were armed with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 auto-cannon. Some later versions used the similar 2 cm KwK 38 L/55. This auto-cannon was based on the 2 cm FlaK 30 anti-aircraft gun, and was capable of firing at a rate of 600 rounds per minute (280 rounds per minute sustained) from 10-round magazines."

 germany.400.d:0 "The Tiger was a formidable machine that pushed the boundaries of armoured warfare and forced the Allies to devise better tanks. It symbolized all the might of the Nazi war machine, as dreamed of by Hitler, and later turned through propaganda into a “Wunderwaffe” (wonder weapon) in a mostly defensive war. Officially ordered for development in May 1941, its roots can be traced back to 1937 with the DW (Durchbruchswagen) I and II and the VK 6501, VK 3001 and VK 3601 Prototypes. The new VK 4501 was developed in parallel by Henschel and Porsche. Henschel redeveloped the VK3601 by enlarging the chassis to carry a suitable turret with the 88mm gun. Porsche however had a complicated design in mind with coupled combustion/electric motors which were unreliable ( its chassis was later used for the Elefant TD). Henschel ultimately won the contest and the production of the first Tigers started in August 1942. Its combat debut took place near Leningrad on the 29th of August 1942 in unfavourable terrain which led to desaster and the breakdown of all vehicles and the permanent loss of one of the 4 Tigers. Like all new tanks, the Tiger had teething problems at first and it was never an easy tank to maintain, but it was continously improved technically and always deadly (with a 10:1 up to 19:1 kill ratio), earning a fear inspiring reputation that was unrivalled during the war. Only experienced crews were allocated to Tiger units to emphasize its elite status. Many humble PzIV were later misidentified as Tigers and may have caused a hasty retreat, thus vastly exaggerating its real numbers (only 1350 were ever built)."

Since the early SPG´s were in part failures like the Bison I (on Panzer I chassis) and Sturmpanzer II (on the Panzer II chassis) using the sIG-33 infantry gun, the Wespe was the first really successful german light self propelled gun using the leFH18. It was used for the first time in Kursk in 1943 and was intended to serve with the Panzerdivisionen alongside the heavier “Hummel”. Due to their reliability and low combat attrition they continued to serve faithfully until´45.

Because the recoil length with a single-chamber, ball-shaped muzzle brake was too great for the tank's turret, the recoil mechanism and chamber were shortened. This resulted in the interim 75mm KwK 40 L/43. The new gun was first installed in March´42 in a regular PzIVF which was then called F2, after producing 200 F2´s and some minor modifications the version was renamed to PzIV G. The final version of the KwK 40 available in early´43 had an improved muzzle break so the lengthened L/48 could be installed from then on. When the new KwK 40 was loaded with the Pzgr.39 armour-piercing shell, the new gun fired the AP shell at some 790m/s ( 740m/s with the L/43), a substantial 83% increase over the howitzer-like KwK 37 L/24 gun's 430m/s muzzle velocity. With the standard Panzergranate 39, the KwK 40 L/48 could now penetrate 109mm of steel armour at an angle of 90° and a range of 1000m, at the same combat range 54mm of armour sloped at 60° could be penetrated as well, so now all T-34 versions (front hull armour 45mm sloped at 60°) could be attacked reliably from the front and was now a match for the - until then - almost invulnerable T-34. Finally the PzIV graduated from a mere support tank to Germany´s main combat tank until ´45 and was the only tank world wide which was in continuous production from the beginning of the war until its end."

Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war.  It is considered one of the best tanks of World War II for its excellent firepower and protection, although its reliability was not impressive at first. The Panther was a compromise - while having essentially the same engine as the Tiger I, it had more efficient frontal hull armour, better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger I. The trade-off was weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire. The Panther was far cheaper to produce than the Tiger I, and only slightly more expensive than the Panzer IV. Key elements of the Panther design, such as its armour, transmission, and final drive, were simplifications made to improve production rates and address raw material shortages. The overall design remained somewhat over-engineered. The Panther D was rushed into combat at the Battle of Kursk despite numerous unresolved technical problems, leading to high losses due to mechanical failure. Most design flaws were rectified by late 1943 and the spring of 1944. The Panther proved to be effective in open country and long range engagements, but the high velocity gun did not provide enough high explosive firepower against infantry. The D and A versions side armour of 40mm could even be penetrated by the 14,5mm PTRS/PTRD AT Rifle under very (!) favourable conditions like higher ground and perfect alignment. This was redeemed with the "G" versions 50mm side armour and the addition of side skirts."

It was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III tank, replacing the turret with an armored, fixed superstructure mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended as a mobile assault gun for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG III was continually modified, and much like the later Jagdpanzer, was employed as a tank destroyer. The Sturmgeschütz III series assault guns proved very successful and served on all fronts as assault guns and tank destroyers. Because of their low silhouette, StuG IIIs were easy to camouflage and were difficult targets. As of 10 April 1945, there still were 1,053 StuG IIIs and 277 StuH 42s in service. The StuG assault guns were cost-effective compared to the heavier German tanks, though as anti-tank guns they were best used defensively, as the lack of a traversable turret was a severe disadvantage in the attack. As the German military situation deteriorated later in the war, more StuGs were built than tanks."

The 37mm gun was sufficient against the polish light tanks but in France it was already insufficient to penetrate any of the modern French tanks which was paid for in heavy losses ( 1/3rd of all used PzIII ). Thus the decision to up-gun the Pz.III with a shorter 50mm L/42 gun was made but many Pz.III still had the 37mm when Barbarossa was unleashed. Later a longer 50mm L/60 gun was installed and had limited success against the T-34 but due to its limitations of the turret and the turret ring there was no hope to install any high velocity guns larger than 50mm which meant that it was now obsolete and was discontinued as a turreted combat tank in 1943. Its chassis however was used extensively for assault guns and SPG´s. Older Pz.III were upgraded with the short 75mm L/24 gun of the early Pz.IV´s to act as infantry support tanks reversing the earlier roles of the III/IV types."

The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger turretless tank destroyer. Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking seals and gaskets, and an overburdened drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure. The introduction of modified seals, gaskets and drive train components, as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance improved the tank's mechanical reliability. Not withstanding its initial reliability problems, the Tiger II was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle. Contemporary German records and testing results indicate that its tactical mobility was as good as or better than most German or Allied tanks.

The SS-VT had to depend on the German Army for its supply of weapons and military training, and they had control of the recruiting system through local draft boards responsible for assigning conscripts to the different branches of the Wehrmacht to meet quotas set by the German High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or OKW in German). The SS was given the lowest priority for recruits, thereby limiting its size."

Once World War II in Europe commenced, the physical requirements were no longer strictly enforced, and essentially any recruit who could pass a basic medical exam was considered for Waffen-SS service. Following the campaign in the West in 1940, Hitler authorized the enlistment of "people perceived to be of related stock", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks. A number of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns volunteered to fight in the Waffen-SS under the command of German officers. Non-Germanic units such as the "Indische Tiger Legion" and the "Azad Hind Legion" were not considered to be part of the SS directly, which still maintained its strict racial criteria, but rather were considered to be foreign nationals serving under the command of the SS."

The major dislocation of the population caused by mobilisation and mass evacuation and also the wartime need for complete manpower control and planning in order to maximise the efficiency of the war economy.\n\n2. The likelihood of rationing (introduced from January 1940 onwards).\n\n3. Population statistics. As the last census had been held in 1931, there was little accurate data on which to base vital planning decisions.

Being purged from the Party means imprisonment or death. Dark times lie ahead for those who show disloyalty - or just a bit too much loyalty to seem credible."

Documents acquired by the NKVD have implicated several high-ranking officers as not only traitors, but spies. Mikhail Tukhachevsky is among the most prominent of the suspects, and one Stalin is keen to rid the army of. Meanwhile, the navy's frequent contact with foreigners has led to many of them being arrested as well.\n\nAlthough there are documents from our enemies proving their guilt, there is no telling if they fabricated them, or if they were given false information by those who wanted this purge in motion to begin with."

The charges are also more extensive than previously, including decade-old plots to murder Soviet leaders and sell the Union to its enemies.\n\nThe fact that the NKVD themselves are now among the targets of the purge has in a sense brought the proceedings in full circle. Threats and beatings have led to many confessing to all charges, even the most outlandish ones. The leading defendants face execution."

Today, Leon Trotsky re-emerged as having returned from his exile, and with the support of several influential party members and NKVD officers, launched a coup overthrowing Stalin's rule.\n\nThe former General Secretary was attacked in his home with an ice axe, and was swiftly executed along with several of his supporters. Tearing down the cult of personality he built up will take time, but the people know now at least that he was not immortal.\n\n One of the few survivors who managed to escape was Ivan Konev.

Their stated goal is to overthrow Stalin's tyranny and transition from a totalitarian state, with a board of military officers overseeing the process.\n\nStalin's supporters in the military and the Party have rallied to retain the current regime, calling their opponents counter-revolutionary traitors.

 soviet.340.t:0 "The T-34/76"
 soviet.340.d:0 "The T-34/76, a Soviet medium tank, had a profound and lasting effect on the field of tank design. At its introduction in 1940, the T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness and outclassed every other tank in existence then, although it was initially lacking in many other regards such as communication, visibility, mechanical reliability and lacking a 3-man turret. Its initial F-11 76,2 mm L/30,5 tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries while its well-sloped frontal armour ( 45mm sloped at 60° ) was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons. Upgrades in 1941 led to a slight increase of armour and a turret redesign in order to be up-gunned with an improved F-34 76,2mm L/42,5 gun which remained its standard armament until introduction of the T-34/85.\n\nIts Christie suspension (first tried with the BT-tank series) was inherited from the design of American Walter Christie’s M1928 tank (rejected by the US military), two of which were sold turretless disguised as "farm tractors" to the Red Army.\n\nAlthough its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war, it has been often credited to have been the most influential tank design of the Second World War.\n\nThe T-34 was the mainstay of Soviet armoured forces throughout the Second World War. Its design allowed it to be continuously refined to meet the constantly evolving needs of the Eastern Front: while the war went on it became more capable, but also quicker and cheaper to produce. Soviet industry would eventually produce over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded while the war progressed, despite the horrible losses in combat against the German Wehrmacht ( at 44,900 losses during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses of all time). Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most produced tank ever (after its successor, the T-54/55 series). "
 soviet.340.a:0 "For the Motherland !"
 
 soviet.341.t:0 "The T-34/85"
 soviet.341.d:0 "After improved German Panzer IV´s and Stug´s with the high-velocity 75 mm L/48 gun were encountered in combat in 1942 and the heavier german tanks like the Tiger and Panther appeared, the T-43 project was begun but eventually failed by not having enough performance to justify the retooling of the factories.\n\nWith the T-43 canceled, the Soviet command made the decision to retool the factories to produce an improved version of the T-34. Its turret ring was enlarged from 1,425 mm to 1,600 mm, allowing a larger turret to be fitted and thus the larger 85 mm L/55 gun ( derived from the anti air gun M1939 52-K). The prototype T-43's turret design was hurriedly adopted by Vyacheslav Kerichev at the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory to fit the T-34. This was a larger three-man turret, with radio (previously in the hull) and observation cupola in the roof. Now the tank commander needed only to command (aided by cupola and radio systems), leaving the operation of the gun to the gunner and the loader. The turret armour was much thicker, 90 mm, even if bigger and less sloped than the original T-34 turret. This made the turret, overall, a bigger target (due to the three-man crew and bigger gun), but more resistant to enemy fire. The resulting new tank, the T-34-85, was seen as a improvement over the earlier T-34.\n\nProduction of the T-34-85 began in January 1944, eventually using the S-53 gun. The improved T-34-85 became the standard Soviet medium tank, with an uninterrupted production run until the end of the war. By May 1944, T-34-85 production had reached 1,200 tanks per month. "

 soviet.342.t:0 "The KV I"
 soviet.342.d:0 "The Kliment Voroshilov (KV) tanks were known for their heavy armour protection during the early stages of the war. Until the Germans developed more effective guns the KV tanks were practically immune to the 3.7 cm KwK 36 and short-barreled 7.5 cm KwK 37 guns of the early Panzer III and Panzer IV, except the 8.8 cm Flak gun which was called whenever a KV was encountered.\n\nPrior to the start of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, about 500 of the over 22,000 tanks then in Soviet service were of the KV-1 type. As the war progressed, it became evident that there was little sense in producing the expensive KV tanks, as the T-34 medium tank performed better (or at least equally well) in all practical respects. In fact the only advantage the KV had over the T-34/76 was its larger and roomier three-man turret. Later in the war, the KV series became a base for the development of the IS (Iosif Stalin) series of tanks and self-propelled guns.\n\nThe KV was ordered right off the drawing board. and sent together with other new designs to the Winter War, where it outperformed the others. The KV's heavy armour proved highly resistant to Finnish anti-tank weapons, making it more difficult to stop. During the war, the Soviets found it difficult to deal with the concrete bunkers used by the Finns and a request was made for a tank with a large 152mm howitzer designated as KV-2 Heavy Artillery Tank ( which was discontinued after disappointing performances ). KV tanks first faced the Germans in the Battle of Raseiniai, just after the start of Operation Barbarossa. \n\nThe KV's strength was its sloped front armour of 90mm, and good firepower with the 76mm F-32 L/30,5 gun ( later the ZiS-5 L/42,5 ) , and that it had good flotation on soft ground. It also had serious flaws: it was difficult to steer; the transmission (which was a twenty-year-old Holt Caterpillar design) "was the main stumbling block of the KV-1, and there was some truth to rumors of Soviet drivers having to shift gears with a hand sledge"; and the ergonomics were poor, with limited visibility. Furthermore, at 45 tons, it was simply too heavy. It was phased out of production in 1943 after several modifications were tried. It was succeeded by the IS Tank."
 soviet.342.a:0 "Shifting gears ? Hammertime !"
 
 soviet.343.t:0 "The IS"
 soviet.343.d:0 "The IS Tank was a series of heavy tanks developed as a successor to the KV-series by the Soviet Union during World War II. The IS acronym is the anglicized initialism of Joseph Stalin. The heavy tanks were designed with thick armor to counter German 88 mm guns and carried a main gun capable of defeating Tiger II, Tiger I, and Panther tanks. They were mainly designed as breakthrough tanks, firing a heavy high-explosive shell that was useful against entrenchments and bunkers. The IS-2 went into service in April 1944 and was used as a spearhead by the Red Army in the final stage of the Battle of Berlin. The much later IS-3 never reached the front lines.\n\nAfter mating a KV-1S chassis with a Object 237 turret, the first iteration of the IS was born. Later a redesigned chassis with the same turret became the IS-85 or IS-1 tank. The 85mm D5-T gun was considered too light when the medium T-34/85 was carrying the same, so the IS-2 was designed using a 122mm D25-T L/45.\n\nIt was accepted for production as the IS-85 heavy tank and first deliveries were made in October 1943. Production ended in January 1944. Its designation was simplified to IS-1 after the introduction of the IS-122, later renamed as IS-2 for security purposes. \n\nWith 100 mm of frontal armour sloped at 60° and 100 mm of rounded turret armour the IS-1/2 was very hard to kill and its 122mm gun could penetrate a Panther from front to back at over 1000m and could threaten a King Tiger."

 soviet.344.t:0 "The SU-85"
 soviet.344.d:0 "The SU-85 medium tank destroyer was a modification of the earlier SU-122 self-propelled howitzer ( designed in Aug´1942), essentially replacing the 122 mm M-30S howitzer of the SU-122 with a D-5T high-velocity 85 mm antitank gun. The D-5T was capable of penetrating the Tiger I from 1000 m. The vehicle had a low profile and excellent mobility. Initially given an armored commander's cap on the first batch, the SU-85's observational optics were improved by the introduction of a standard commander's cupola - the same as on the T-34/76 model 1942 - in addition to the already existing prismatic observation sights installed in left side and rear.\n\nSU-85 production started in mid-1943, with the first vehicles reaching their units by August. When the up-gunned T-34-85 medium tank entered mass production in the spring of 1944, there was no point in continuing production of a tank destroyer without superior firepower. In light of this, SU-85 production was stopped in late 1944 after 2,050 vehicles had been produced. It was replaced on the production lines by the SU-100 tank destroyer, armed with the more powerful 100 mm D-10S gun.\n\nThere were two versions: the basic SU-85 had a fixed commander's cupola with a rotating periscope and three vision blocks; the improved SU-85M had the same casemate as the later SU-100, with a commander's cupola as used on the T-34-85"

 kns.1.d:0 "With the failure in conquering China, comes the uproar of the Japanese people. This major setback of Japan has given chance for the democrats to organize a revolution to overthrow the current fascist government. With the losing war and the dissidents of the people, Hirohito's dream is over."
 kns.1.a:0 "This is a total defeat for the fascist bastards!"
 kns.1.b:0 "Interesting development."

 kns.2.t:0 "End of Japanese Civil War"
 kns.2.d_f:0 "Despite numerous guerilla warfare and popular supports, the democratic supporters had been defeated in the Japanese civil war. All suspects were detained or executed. In order to stabilize the situation, Emperor Hirohito gave a speech to the Japanese public stated that war is their only destiny. However, the crowd's response stated otherwise."
 kns.2.d_d:0 "After hours of assault to the emperor's bunker, the fascist regime surrendered to the democratic supporters. Having won the civil war, the democratic cabinet is now trying to mend the wounds caused by the former fascist regime. 'We do not hope to be forgiven, but we will do our part nonetheless.' said one of the Japanese democratic revolutionaries."
 kns.2.a:0 "Hope the Japanese know what they are doing..."
 kns.3.t:0 "Fall Of Beijing"
 kns.3.d:0 "After a failed raid of the Japanese front line HQ, the Chinese suffered enormous casualties. In order to prevent further casualties, the Chinese commander has ordered the troops to retreat out of Beijing. The Japanese Army later marched into the city with minimal resistance.\n\nThe Forbidden Palace has reported to have some artefacts removed by the Japanese. Fortunately most of it was evacuated back in 1933 to the south, so the Japanese were only able to remove a few large bronze tubs and a few pieces of cannon."

 better_canada.4.t:0 "A Plebiscite is Held"
 better_canada.4.d:0 "The results are in. Every territory and province, except Quebéc, votes in large majority for the expansion of conscription rules. The troublesome aspect is that not only did Quebéc vote no, they voted nearly 73% against it. It is very likely that things will not change in Quebec in terms of conscription. Perhaps in light of what their peers have said they will change their minds, even if just a little. Of course we could be more forceful instead."

When an angry mob approached the bases instead of fighting they instead were told to stand down by local officers, citing that it should be the will of the people to decide their own fate. As a result the garrisons were allowed to leave safely and forthright Newfoundland and Labrador belong to us."
 better_canada.5.a:0 "Just as planned"
 better_canada.6.d:0 "Earlier this morning locals of Newfoundland and Labrador were incited to a mob and marched onto the various garrison bases demanding their independence from [ENG.GetName]. The officers, fearing a senseless bloodshed, gave in to their demands and the [ENG.GetNameDef] troops were allowed to leave peacefully. There are already whispers that this was far too coordinated to have simply have been a 'random' set of mobs and accusations have been already levied towards [CAN.GetName] as being the likely culprit."

The Mark I was also known as Matilda, and the larger A12 was initially known as the Matilda II, Matilda senior or Waltzing Matilda. The Mark I was abandoned in 1940, and from then on the A12 was almost always known simply as "the Matilda". /nWith its heavy armour, the Matilda II was an excellent infantry support tank but with somewhat limited speed and armament. During the battle of France and in the north African desert nothing but the 88mm Flak was able to scratch the Matilda II, earning it the nickname Queen of the desert. It was the only British tank to serve from the start of the war to its end, although it is particularly associated with the North Africa Campaign.

The Crusader tank would not see active service beyond Africa, but the chassis of the tank was modified to create anti-aircraft, fire support, observation, communication, bulldozer and recovery vehicle variants. /nThe first variation 'Crusader I' tank entered service in 1941, and, though manoeuvrable, it was relatively lightly armoured and under-armed. Improved armour thickness to 49mm marked out the "Crusader II' variant. The main armament for the Crusader Mark I and II's was an Ordnance QF 2 pounder (40mm) main gun, but the 'Crusader III' was fitted with an Ordnance QF 6 pounder (57mm) main gun. This variant was more than a match for the mid-generation German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks that it faced in combat.

The name "Cromwell" was initially applied to three vehicles during development. Early Cromwell development led to the creation of the A24 Cavalier. Later Cromwell development led to the creation of the competing Tank, Cruiser, Mk VIII, Centaur (A27L) design.

It was one of the heaviest Allied tanks of the war. The Churchill tank was named after Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who had promoted the development of the tank in the First World War. Churchill told Field Marshall Jan Smuts "That is the tank they named after me when they found out it was no damn good!  /nThe origins of the design lay in the expectation that war in Europe might be fought under similar conditions to those of the First World War, and emphasized the ability to cross difficult ground. The Churchill was rushed into production to build up British defences against a possible German invasion. The first vehicles had flaws that had to be overcome before the Churchill was accepted for wide use. After several marks had been built, a better armoured version, the Mark VII, entered service.  /nThe Churchill was used by British and Commonwealth forces in the North Africa campaign, in Italy, and in northwest Europe.

The chassis was also adapted for several other roles, and these have remained in service to this day. /nDevelopment of the Centurion began in 1943 with manufacture beginning in January 1945. Six prototypes arrived in Belgium less than a month after the war in Europe ended in May 1945. It first entered combat with the British Army in the Korean War in 1950, in support of the UN forces. /nIt became one of the most widely used tank designs, equipping armies around the world, with some still in service until the 1990s. As recently as the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict the Israel Defense Forces employed heavily modified Centurions as armoured personnel carriers and combat engineering vehicles.

startevent.2.d:0 "Japan is one of the major Axis-aligned nations in the game. Generally, we can say Japan faces significant resource limitations, especially for oil and rubber. These can be mitigated through aggressive expansion, either north into the USSR or south into China and Southeast Asia. Japan has an impressively-sized navy but has relatively weak naval production capacity. The army is mostly infantry-based and Japan will struggle to keep up with Western armour technology. More information is available to read in each tab."

startevent.3.t:0 "Empire of Japan - History"
startevent.3.d:0 "Imperial Japan's rapid industrialization and militarization led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire. Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism, eventually culminating in Japan's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n In 1931, Japan invaded and conquered the North-east China / Manchuria, with little resistance. Japan invaded China proper in 1937, creating what was essentially a three-way war between Japan, Mao Zedong's communists, and Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists.\n\n In late 1941, Japan's government, led by Prime Minister and General Hideki Tojo, decided to break the US-led embargo through force of arms. In the early stages of the war, Japan scored victory after victory. The tide began to turn against Japan following the Battle of Midway in June 1942 and the subsequent Battle of Guadalcanal, in which Allied troops wrested the Solomon Islands from Japanese control. on August 6, 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb over Hiroshima, killing over 90,000 people. The unconditional surrender of Japan was announced by Emperor Hirohito on August 14."
startevent.4.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Army"
startevent.4.b:0 "Tell me more about the technologies"
startevent.4.d:0 "Imperial Japan has a relatively small number of operational divisions at game start. Infantry divisions are mostly over-strength; 15 divisions are in either a 3x5 or 4x5 pattern, meaning the divisions are around twice as large as comparable 3x3 regimented divisions. If going on the offensive making these divisions smaller and better equipped with logistics may prove useful in the dispersed, low-infrastructure areas Japan will likely be invading.\n\n At first Japan has 4 small Marine Divisions which are able to land quickly on unopposed beaches but they need to be upgraded and expanded to reliably capture all of the chinese ports or heavily garrisoned ones. \n\nJapan's 3 mixed infantry divisions and 9 cavalry divisions can serve as a basis for either a light secondary infantry force, or can be motorized / mechanized later on. Japan has 2 motorized divisions which are quite developed. Japan's armour is lacking, with only 2 small brigade-sized groupings, and will require substantial investment to improve. However against the Chinese lacking in anti tank capabilities the japanese tanks are usually sufficient. \n\nJapan also has 30 garrison divisions, mostly stationed in the Pacific islands. These can be either disbanded or retooled to defend other areas, depending on your priorities."
startevent.5.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Navy"
startevent.5.d:0 "Imperial Japan starts with one of the most impressive navies in the game, only outclassed by the USA and UK. Japan starts with 2 relatively modern aircraft carriers and 2 light aircraft carriers, which form a healthy baseline from which to build a larger, dispersed carrier fleet. \n\nJapan has 6 battleships and 4 battlecruisers completed at start, which are all fairly modern. Japan also has considerable numbers of medium-sized ships: 17 heavy cruisers and 19 light cruisers of varying age. Japan has 92 screening ships at game start, which are similarly split between modern and interwar.\n\n The submarine fleet of 52 is large but somewhat out of date. \n\nJapan's initial production queue has 2 carriers, 4 heavy cruisers, 13 destroyers, and 7 submarines. \n\nThe player can choose whether to prioritize capital ships over a raiding fleet, or if Japan should focus more resources on battleships as opposed to fleet carriers. Ultimately, Japan's biggest naval weakness is its difficulty rebuilding its fleet due to its output to fleet size ratio. \n\n Also initially you neither have the fuel storage capacity nor the fuel production to sustain fielding the whole fleet, e.g. against the Chinese its a massive waste to send more than selected parts of the fleet and if you do anyway then most of your trading capacity and merchant fleet will be tied up shipping oil to Japan ( costing around 100 units of oil per day). If you cannot field that amount of oil/fuel in 1942, then the size of your fleet is irrelevant and you will be crushed by the USN. Even if you ignore oil synthetics and rely on the capture of the oil fields in SE-Asia you need to develop oil technologies to get the most out of every drop of oil for fuel."
startevent.6.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Airforce"
startevent.6.d:0 "Japan's airforce is quite unique. The IJA and IJN both competed for power and influence in the Japanese state, and operated almost totally independently in many cases. This can be seen in their air developments - both branches had separate planes which they used. Most of the IJN airforce in 1936 was located in Taiwan, with about around 900 planes, most of which are naval bombers, short-range fighters and close air support. The IJA airforce was split between Manchuria and the Home Islands, with about 850 aircraft, again mostly short-range fighters and close air support, with some medium bombers. \n\nWhile Japan does have good short-range planes, it will need a significant investment of research in order to develop longer-range bombers or fighters - and if you are playing historical, you will need to double this, as both military branches will require separate technology investment."
startevent.7.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Strategy"
startevent.7.d:0 "Japan's lack of material resources and existing military adventures in East Asia will make your first priority the subjugation of China, which has tremendous manpower and good amounts of natural resources to exploit. In TW China is no pushover and will offer fierce resistance, after initial success you will probably get bogged down in the badly supplied Chinese Interior and you will need suitably adapted divisions for that. IMPORTANT: Since the war with China began somewhat lacklustre you will need to escalate the war by repeatedly choosing the decisions to "Escalate the War in China", otherwise you will remain with a hefty malus for fighting.\n\n After this, Japan is presented with two equally difficult options: to either strike north into the USSR using land forces, or to strike south using naval forces. Japan's productive capacity will limit its ability to do both simultaneously and so only one should be considered. Going north will require building up Manchurian infrastructure and Japan's lacking armoured forces, while going south will require additional naval invasion forces and using natural resources for the Imperial Japanese Navy."

 blackicenavalevents.1.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Hiryū-class aircraft carrier. The IJN Sōryū ("Blue Dragon") and IJN Hiryū ("Flying Dragon") were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armoured. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations. These were the first modern aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the platform further aircraft carrier development was based on."

The two Shōkaku-class carriers Shōkaku ("Soaring Crane") and Zuikaku ("Auspicious Crane") were ordered in 1937 as part of the 3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Program. Completed shortly before the start of the Pacific War in 1941, they have been called "arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world" when built. The Shōkaku-class carriers were initially intended to have an air group of 96, including 24 aircraft in reserve. All of these aircraft were either superseded by larger, more modern aircraft or cancelled while the ships were being built, so the air group was revised for a total of 84 aircraft."

 blackicenavalevents.3.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Shinano-class aircraft carrier. The IJN Shinano was laid down as one of the three Yamato-class super heavy battleships. After the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, the Imperial Japanese Navy ordered the ship's unfinished hull (45% construction completed) converted into an aircraft carrier. The Shinano featured the heaviest anti aircraft armament of all IJN carriers, heavy armour protection and was the very first carrier of the IJN to have a full armoured flight deck, thanks to its Yamato-class legacy. The Shinano-class carried a huge air group of 120 aircraft. The Imperial Japanese Navy decided that carriers of the heavily armoured Shinano class would either serve as a support carrier or floating battle fortress at the front line for the Combined Fleets battle line."

The IJN Taihō ("Great Phoenix") was approved for construction in the 1939 4th Supplementary Programme. Her design was that of a modified Shōkaku with slightly reduced speed but stronger hull and armour protection. Under the Modified Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942, Taihō was to be the first of a new generation of Japanese aircraft carriers featuring a armoured flight deck and better overall armour protection against dive bombers and was expected to not only survive multiple bomb, torpedo, or shell hits, but also continue fighting effectively afterwards. Also the anti aircraft armament was significantly increased. After the launch of the IJN Taihō, it became almost immediately the flagship of the Combined Fleet."

Both ships of the class, Hiyō ("Flying Hawk") and Jun'yō ("Peregrine Falcon"), were originally laid down as luxury passenger liners before being acquired by the IJN for conversion to aircraft carriers in 1941. Their air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M "Claude" fighters, plus 4 in storage, 18 Aichi D3A "Val" dive bombers, with an additional 2 in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N "Kate" torpedo bombers.

In the lead-up to the Pacific War the Imperial Japanese Navy attempted to build a large number of fleet carriers, in fact 16. The lead ship was IJN Unryū ("Cloud Dragon") For them to be built quickly, the design for these ships was based on the aircraft carrier Hiryū rather than the newer and more sophisticated Taihō or the Shōkaku class. The Unryū-class aircraft carrier design was very similar to that of Hiryū. The ships were lightly built, and the main difference from Hiryū was that the carriers' island was placed on the starboard side of the ships. The carriers were capable of carrying 63 aircraft in two hangars, and were fitted with two elevators."

 blackicenavalevents.21.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the King George-class battleship. The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-calibre cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller calibre, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."

The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the ageing Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armour and more powerful engines."

The Illustrious class was a four ship class (Illustrious, Formidable, Victorious and Indomitable) of aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy. They were laid down in the late 1930s as part of the rearmament of British forces in response to the emerging threats of Germany, Italy and Imperial Japan. The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. It was one of the first carrier designs featuring a armoured flight deck for better protection against dive bombers."

 blackicenavalevents.24.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Implacable-class aircraft carrier. The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
