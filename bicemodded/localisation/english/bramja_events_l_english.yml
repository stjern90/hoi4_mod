One leader of the formerly subjected nations formulated it as follows:\n\"The Japanese were supposedly freeing us from Western imperialism. However in the end they were worse as an antidote than the poison itself...\" The reason why this is happening now is obvious: with their navy mostly resting at the bottom of the sea, the [From.GetAdjective] overseas holdings had been cut off from the Home Islands.

Thus it has ever been.\"§!\n\nSo it was written in China's most read book the \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" (Sānguó Yǎnyì). The book phrases a view common throughout the East, a philosophy which conceives history as circular, Ying & Yang, as the eternal self eating snake, the ever swinging pendulum, back and forth, never really moving. Westerners often grew up with the linear view of history, as if always working its way to a final climax (or rather a literal Apocalypse), as so it is taught by the Abrahamic Religions. Not surprisingly, this difference in worldview has been used by Westerners to explain and justify their superiority over the world, as this would lead to a more active, driven people who wouldn't accept their lot but would always strive for more... \n \nRecent events in China could prove the already battered beliefs of the West wrong. Recently the well known saying has been going over the lips markedly more throughout China, as adapted versions of the Chinese novel spread out from the North. The adaptions are well crafted, stressings the analogies between the present and the past. This is only one of many ways how the idea spreads that \"the unity and prosperity  of the Chinese realm\" shall soon return, guided by the Mandate of Heaven."

Today in [Root.Capital.GetName] it was announced in the proper ritualistic fashion, how [FROM.GetLeader] was crowned Emperor of all of China once more. The final defeat of China's existential threats by the [From.GetAdjective] armies, had proven to whom the Mandate rightfully belonged, just as it had before. \nThe [From.GetRulingParty] have proven to be excellent propagandists over the last decade, using the course of events of the last decennia until now to fit a story with only one possible conclusion, the Qing, and the Qing only can show the path for China to regain its place in the world, in the center of it! Even the most cynic Western colonialist or idealistic Chinese republicans, must at times doubt their cause, as [From.GetName] now likely is the  most developed, resource rich and well armed state left in the Middle Kingdom.\nWill the Chinese Empire stand and complete the cycle once more, showing the world the Middle Kingdom ìs to last forever?
