 ### PLA Navy ###
 CCP_submarine_1:0 "AG Class"
 CCP_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 CCP_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shchuka"
 CCP_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV K-Class"
 CCP_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_4:0 "Han Class"
 CCP_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 CCP_destroyer_1:0 "Type 30 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
 CCP_destroyer_2:0 "Type 39 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 CCP_destroyer_3:0 "Type 42 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 CCP_destroyer_4:0 "Type 52 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
 CCP_light_cruiser_1:0 "Type 28C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 CCP_light_cruiser_2:0 "Type 35C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 CCP_light_cruiser_3:0 "Type 44C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 CCP_light_cruiser_4:0 "Type 50C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Type 30HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Type 38HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Type 43HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Type 58HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Type 40BC Class"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Type 51BC Class"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 CCP_battleship_1:0 "Zhou  Class"
 CCP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 CCP_battleship_2:0 "Chen Class"
 CCP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 CCP_battleship_3:0 "Zhu De Class"
 CCP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 CCP_battleship_4:0 "Mao Class"
 CCP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 CCP_SH_battleship_1:0 "Type 50SHBB Project"
 CCP_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 CCP_SH_battleship_2:0 "Type 59SHBB Project"
 CCP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 CCP_carrier_1:0 "Yulin Class"
 CCP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 CCP_carrier_2:0 "Shanghai Class"
 CCP_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 CCP_carrier_3:0 "Beijing Class"
 CCP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 CCP_carrier_4:0 "Liaoning Class"
 CCP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

 JAP_infantry_weapons_short:0 "Type 38 Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "The Type 38 Rifle Arisaka was a bolt-action rifle developed as an advancement on the Type 30 after the Russo-Japanese War. It used a low-recoil 6.5x50mm cartridge which lacked penetrating power. It was a very long rifle, at 1.28 meters, due to the Japanese emphasis on bayonet fighting. The rifle gained an additional 0.4m when the bayonet was fixed. About 3,400,000 were produced from 1906 to 1942."

 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Type 99 Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Type 99 Rifle Arisaka was a bolt-action rifle developed during the war to replace the outclassed Type 38. The Type 99 was designed similarly to the Type 38, but fired a 7.7mm cartridge instead of a 6.5x50mm. It was a solid bolt-action rifle, but was outclassed at close range by automatic weapons. While it was intended to completely replace the Type 38, this never materialized due to resource and production constraints. About 3,500,000 were built from 1939 to 1945."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Type 1 Rifle Arisaka"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Rifle Type 1"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Type 1 Rifle Arisaka was an improvement of the existing Type 99 rifle. It was developed after experiences from the war in China and was made in preparation for the Blitzkreig in the East. It fired the same cartridges as the type 99, but it's performance and reliability was considerably improved.
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Arisaka Type 4 / Type 5 (Japanese Garand)"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Arisaka Type 4 Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Type 100/44 Submachine Gun was an improved version of the Type 100 which featured a considerably higher firing rate of 800 rpm, and much better reliability due to less complicated design. The barrel was slightly longer, and the bayonet mounting bar / bipod were eliminated. Due to the late stage of the war, corners were cut frequently in production, but the weapon still had great field performance. About 8,000 were built from 1944 to 1945."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4:0 "Type 4 Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "Type 4"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Type 4 Rifle was a Japanese response to semi-automatic rifle development in other countries. Rather than designing one from scratch, they elected to copy the M1 Garand, which they were coming into frequent contact with on the Pacfic Theater. The Type 4 was a reversed engineered copy of the M1 Garand, which had an internal magazine as opposed to an en-bloc clip. The rifle was supposed to begin mass production in 1945, but only 100 of a 250-gun order were completed before the war ended."

In all, over 1,400 Pz. 38(t)s were manufactured. The chassis of the Pz. 38(t) continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942–1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944–1945) tank destroyers and its derivative vehicles. It was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II that were the Panzerwaffe's main tanks during the outset of WWII. The Panzer 38(t) performed well in the Polish Campaign in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940. It was better armed than the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks.

 panzer_ii_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzer II is the common name used for a family of German tanks used in World War II. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen II. Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while larger, more advanced tanks were developed, it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II, during the Polish and French campaigns. The Panzer II was the most numerous tank in the German Panzer divisions beginning with the invasion of France. It was used in both North Africa against the British and on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. A/B/C were very similar and had a weight of 8.9 tons, maximal armour of 15mm, a crew of 3 and a top speed of 40 km/h. Ausf.C became the main production model from 1938 on. "

Only the turret was the same as the Ausf.

The design was shorter (4.65 m) but wider (2.3 m) and taller (2.06 m) than the Ausf. C. The Ausf. E differed from the Ausf. D only by having lubricated tracks. It used the same 20mm/L55 cannon as the A/B/C and had a crew of 3. Many of the earlier Pz-II versions were uparmored. Although it reached a top speed of 55 km/h it had less performance cross country than the predecessors  because of the torsion-bars. "

The base plate of the mortar was under the hull and could be quickly lowered and retracted for movement and firing, the lowered base plate would absorb the recoil of the heavy mortar and protect the suspension.The ability to observe its own mortar shells impacts on the battlefield greatly increased accuracy while light AT fire could be shrugged off. It could not carry much ammo, so it had to rely on weaponless Mücke ammo carriers ( which could be converted with mortars of disabled vehicles if necessary). "

The shell - a modified 82mm mortar round combined with a redesigned 105mm cartridge - had an effective range of 750m ( at which a 1 meter target could be hit reliably ) and a penetration of 140mm, it so gave the usually low velocity HEAT shells a much better trajectory and accuracy."

To simplify production, the vision ports on either side of the turret and the loader's forward vision port in the turret front were removed, while a rack for two spare road wheels was installed on the track guard on the left side of the hull. Complementing this, brackets for seven spare track links were added to the glacis plate."

 panzer_vii_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzerkampfwagen VII Löwe (Lion) was a design for a super-Heavy Tank created by Krupp. The project, initially code-named VK 7001 (K), weighed 90 tons , with 140 mm frontal and rounded turret front armor, 100mm side armor. The chassis was quite similar to the Tiger II. Armament was a 105mm L/70 gun  gun, and it had a Maybach HL230 engine with 1000 HP allowing a top road speed of 35 km/h."

 panzer_vii_equipment_2_desc:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus (Mouse) was a German World War II super-Hv.TK completed in late 1944. It is the heaviest fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle ever built so far. The Maus's main armament was a 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun with an added coaxial 75 mm gun."

 panzer_vii_equipment_3_short:0 "Zerberus S-Hv.TK"
 panzer_vii_equipment_3_desc:0 "Pzkpfw.VIII / E-200 'Zerberus/Cerberos', was a S-Heavy tank at 205 tons. It was armed with a 150mm KwK 44 L/38. It had a considerably elongated E-100 Turret (by 1.5 meters) but steeper sloped. Since the Maus was underpowered, a improved Maybach HL232 Turbo with 1200 HP gave now a top road speed of 20 km/h. Secondary it had an armoured blister housing a twin 30mm MK108 on the right Turret roof. It was able to shoot at ground targets as well as air targets at an elevation of 70°. No less than four 92mm Nahverteidigungswaffen ( close defense weapon ) were in the corner roofs of the turret compartment, able to shower each surrounding surface with shrapnell. Due to the steeper sloping the turret armour was thinner than with the Maus at around 200mm at the front and 170mm at the sides which made it better protected vs. ranged attacks and a slightly more difficult target for aerial bombardment but more vulnerable to limpet mines."

It is a fast light fighter aircraft. It was a high speed design dedicated to drag reduction with a new cooling concept, the surface evaporative cooling where the water/glycol coolant was allowed to develop steam and to expand into cooling chambers. This system is almost drag free but would have been very vulnerable to damage. However with the production version He-100 D-1 the cooling was redesigned to a conventional system and additional air cooled radiators were installed. The new D was therefore slower but still managed a speed of 644 km/h. Due to the drag-reduced airframe ranges of 900-1000 km were possible.

Five prototypes were built by Kawasaki Kōkūki Kōgyō K.K. and first flown in 1930. Following testing, the aircraft was ordered into production in 1932 as the Army Type 92 Model 1 Fighter. The aircraft had unequal-span sesquiplane wings and fixed tailwheel landing gear and was powered by a 470 kW (630 hp) BMW VI engine. After 180 aircraft were built, production continued with a structurally strengthened and more powerful Type 92 Model 2.

The design was in response to a requirement issued by the Imperial Japanese Army for a new fighter, and was the winner of a competition against Nakajima's Ki-11. Although the low-wing monoplane offered by Nakajima was more advanced, the Army preferred the more maneuverable biplane offered by Kawasaki. In order to overcome the speed disadvantage the Kawasaki team used a metal three-blade propeller in the third prototype, while flush-head rivets were used in an attempt to reduce drag. The structure was of all-metal construction, which was then fabric-covered. Armament consisted of two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns, synchronized to fire through the propeller. The initial production version was powered by a liquid-cooled 633 kW (850 hp) Kawasaki Ha9-IIa V-12. About 300 of the initial production version were made from December 1935 to October 1937, and another 280 of a second variant, the Ki-10-II, were built from June 1937 to December 1938."

Each turret had an observation slit and a round firing port for the DT machine-gun. These turrets existed in four different models and configurations, although still mounted in the same locations, with the same height and generally same features. All had a 240° arc of fire and armor ranging from 13 to 15 mm (0.51-0.59 in), although the very first 1931 models had only 10 mm (0.39 in) of mediocre alloy, susceptible to machine-gun fire. The model 1931 (100 units), 1932 (1361) and 1933 (before upgrading - 576) were all twin-turreted versions. About 2038 were built in all. "

The main armament will remain unchanged until the end of the production in 1941, but the model 1938 received a brand new cast turret with sloped angles, the same armor and a PTK commander’s panoramic sight for newly radio-equipped commander tanks. This turret was also factory-equipped with a rear gun port, first introduced in 1935, for a third DT machine-gun. After the battle of Lake Khasan in August 1938, the turret base was reinforced with a sloped underturret plate, 20 mm (0.79 in) strong. This late model was called the model 1939 or T-26-1 in some sources. \n In all, 4,826 model 1938 and 1939 tanks were built. "

This machine was called the T-26-6. This was done because the need for a direct fire support weapon was high, as troops needed more direct medium or heavy fire support weapons, and it was a useful way of utilizing obsolete types of T-26 tanks. This new Assault Gun was armed with a 76.2 mm  KT-28 gun. Shortly after production began however, it was decided that some of the chassis would remain as T-26 tanks as stocks of the tanks began to run short. Therefore, only 14 SU-26s were manufactured."

This project was rather a forced measure, as a little earlier "gunners" were deprived of self-propelled guns, which were handed over to the tank units.

Whilst such a large number were produced, it was hated by all who had to deal with it – all except the Germans, who found it to be a substandard and underwhelming opponent, and a rather nice ammunition carrier or gun towing tractor, once captured. \n In 1942, the T-60’s frontal armor was increased to 35 mm (1.37 in), which was still inadequate and made the tank more sluggish. \n Finally, any attempt to increase the caliber of the gun proved difficult. There were attempts to replace the main gun with a 37 mm (1.45 in) ZiS-19 or a 45 mm (1.77 in) ZiS-19BM, but proved unsuccessful as a result of the small turret.

Whilst the gun was generally better suited to the reality of tank-on-tank warfare, it still had poor mobility and underwhelming protection. The tank’s legacy passed on into the somewhat well-known SU-76 self-propelled gun, which was also a less than desirable tank. \n The T-70 was armed with a 45-mm L/46 gun Model 38 with forty-five rounds carried, and a coaxial 7.62-mm DT machine gun."

Both tanks offered similar performance, so introducing the T-44 was not considered as important as increasing T-34 production. Fewer than 2,000 T-44s were built, compared to about 84,000 T-34s.

It used the chassis of the T-44 Med.TK and was intended to replace the SU-100 which itself had only entered service with the Red Army in late 1944. Two prototypes of the Uralmash-1 with different armament were built in early 1945, one with the 100 mm D-10 tank gun, the other with the 122 mm D-25S tank gun. While mass production was initially recommended, the end of the war with Germany in May 1945 eventually caused the project to be cancelled due to lack of necessity. If the Uralmash-1 had entered service, the 100 mm variant would have been designated SU-101 (СУ-101) while the 122 mm variant would have been designated SU-102 (СУ-102)."

NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01:0 "Austin 7"
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01_short:0 "Austin 7"
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01_desc:0 "A military liaison vehicle used to coordinate between units in the field and light transport. This is a military adaption of a later model of one of the most successful series of British cars, the Austin 7. The modifications are relatively sparse, with anything not strictly necessary stripped out, more storage, military wheels, tow rings and an altered fuel tank. Historically the Austin 7 was produced between 1922 and 1939. The British Army purchased a number of batches of Austin 7's for liaison use prewar. Austin and Morris assembly in New Zealand started in 1934. Civilian cars of all kinds were requisitioned at the onset of war, and NZ infantry battalions had an official establishment of 6 Austin two-seaters as of 1941."
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_02:0 "Austin 8"
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_02_short:0 "Austin 8"
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_02_desc:0 "The Austin 7 was succeeded by the Austin 8, which was slightly larger with improved engine and suspension. A large number of civilian models were requisitioned early war and modified, and a factory-built miltary version was constructed, the Military 8AP Tourer. Historically the Austin 8 started production in February 1939, and approximately 9000 Military 8AP Tourers were built."

NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_03_desc:0 "A locally built or refurbished model of the famous 'Jeep', using Willys plans under license by the Ford Motor Company of New Zealand. Historically design occurred late 1940 and production in early 1941. Jeeps and other vehicles were repaired and refurbished in large quantities by New Zealand during the Pacific campaign, and the NZ Army was the second army in the world to field the Jeep."

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_06_short:0 "Lanchester 6x4"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_06_desc:0 "Developed during the 1920s by the Lanchester Motor Company, the 6x4 had good cross country performance and was easy to maintain. It featured a fully traversing, two-man turret, but the 90 hp engine struggled with the vehicle's weight. First deployed in 1929, it served into the 1930s before being phased out."

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_07_short:0 "Morris CS9"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_07_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Morris Commercial C9 truck, the CS9 replaced a number of WWI-era designs. The open-top turret usually mounted a 13.7 mm Boys anti-tank rifle, and a 7.62 mm Bren light machine gun. The 94 hp engine gave the vehicle good performance on soft ground - when fitted with the correct tires."

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_08_short:0 "Daimler Mk II"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_08_desc:0 "A heavier development of the successful Daimler Dingo scout car. Produced in large quantities, their welded, sloped hulls were relatively well armoured, while the 4.1 litre 95 hp engine gave decent performance. The armoured car was equipped with a 2 pdr 40mm gun, and a coaxial 7.92 Besa machine gun."

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_09_short:0 "Humber Mk IV"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_09_desc:0 "Made by the Rootes Group by combining the Indian Army's Karrier KT4 artillery tractor, with the Guy armoured car. The definitive production Mk IV version mounted a US-made 37 mm gun, and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun. The vehicle had a long career and surplus Humbers were sold to nations all over the world."

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_099_short:0 "AEC Mk II"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_099_desc:0 "Built by the Associated Equipment Company on the chassis of their Matador 4x4 artillery tractor. The 158 hp diesel engine enabled the vehicle to mount a 6 pdr 57 mm gun, and coaxial 7.92 mm Besa machine gun, while still maintaining excellent mobility on long patrols. The AEC remained valuable for years to come."

NZL_tankette_equipment_0_desc:0 "A two-crew light armoured vehicle developed from earlier one-crew models. Very lightly armed and armoured it sold well interwar due to it's relatively low price. Historically tankettes were taken rapidly out of frontline use due to their poor performance in combat."

NZL_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "With the UK occupied fully with it's own rearmament, New Zealand assessed a number of stopgap concepts as it developed it's military industry. This is a domestic prototype based on the same concept as the US Disston Tractor Tank. It consists of corrugated iron plates mounted on a large tractor chassis. Historically the prototypes were constructed very quickly adhoc, without plans."

NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "This is a more developed domestic concept based on a Universal Carrier chassis. It had an unusual combination of tracks with demountable road wheels, that gave it respectable strategic speed. The design was in all other respects mediocre, but would have been better than no tank at all."

NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The first Commonwealth three-man Lt.TK in service. The extra crew member, and an updated armament of 7.7 mm and 15 mm Besa machine guns in a twin mount, made the Mk V a far more effective combat vehicle. The increase in weight affected mobility on rough ground somewhat, but overall range was largely unchanged."

The Mk VIa retained the armament of the Mk V, while the Mk VIb had a compact 15 mm Besa and an upgraded 7.92 mm coaxial. The Mk VIc kept the 7.92 mm coaxial, while the main gun was a long barrel 15 mm Besa, which had excellent muzzle velocity but limited punch."

NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "Vickers-Armstrong chief tank designer - Leslie Little - designed the Tetrarch as a major upgrade to the Mk VI. It had a 2 pdr 40 mm gun with a 7.92 mm Besa coaxial, and a new coil suspension system. The light weight of the vehicle coupled with the Meadows 165 hp engine, made the Tetratch fast and easy to transport."
