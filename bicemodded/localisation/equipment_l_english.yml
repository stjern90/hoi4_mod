 JAP_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Type 38 75mm FG"
 JAP_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Type 38 75mm Field Gun was a Krupp-designed conventional field gun, originally designed in Germany in 1905, and then redesigned in the 1930s. The redesign allowed a max elevation of 43 degrees, and the piece was trunnioned forward. About 2,600 of the original version were built from 1905 to the 1930s, and 459 of the improved version were built from the 1930s to 1945."

 JAP_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Type 90 75mm Field Gun was designed to replace the earlier Krupp-designed Type 38 75mm. It had a muzzle brake, unique among Japanese artillery pieces. It was built in both horse-transported and motorized versions. It had a range of 14.96 kilometers and a muzzle velocity of 683 meters per second. 786 were built from 1932 to 1945."

 JAP_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Type 92 10cm Cannon was developed as a long-range alternative to the existing 75mm field guns. It was initially designed in 1923 but production was delayed considerably due to IJA requirements to make the gun lighter and increase the range to 17.5 kilometers. Initial prototypes were built in 1932. While it had issues with transportability, it was otherwise successful. From 1932 to 1945, about 180 were built."

 JAP_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "The Type 38 Rifle Arisaka was a bolt-action rifle developed as an advancement on the Type 30 after the Russo-Japanese War. It used a low-recoil 6.5x50mm cartridge which lacked penetrating power. It was a very long rifle, at 1.28 meters, due to the Japanese emphasis on bayonet fighting. The rifle gained an additional 0.4m when the bayonet was fixed. About 3,400,000 were produced from 1906 to 1942."

 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Type 99 Rifle Arisaka was a bolt-action rifle developed during the war to replace the outclassed Type 38. The Type 99 was designed similarly to the Type 38, but fired a 7.7mm cartridge instead of a 6.5x50mm. It was a solid bolt-action rifle, but was outclassed at close range by automatic weapons. While it was intended to completely replace the Type 38, this never materialized due to resource and production constraints. About 3,500,000 were built from 1939 to 1945."

 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Type 100 SMG"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Type 100 Submachine Gun was the only submachine gun model produced by Japan in significant quantities during the war. It was developed under a low-priority military contract by Nambu Arms and first delivered to the Army in 1942. It was a fully-automatic modified Bergmann MP18, which fired the 8mm Nambu round at 450 rpm. It also had a chrome-plated bore to decrease corrosion in jungle conditions, and could fix a bayonet. One of its 'features' was that the firing pin would not operate until the round was fully chambered, which frequently caused stoppages in firing when in service. About 10,000 were produced from 1942 to 1945."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Type 100/44 Submachine Gun"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Type 100/44 SMG"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Type 100/44 Submachine Gun was an improved version of the Type 100 which featured a considerably higher firing rate of 800 rpm, and much better reliability due to less complicated design. The barrel was slightly longer, and the bayonet mounting bar / bipod were eliminated. Due to the late stage of the war, corners were cut frequently in production, but the weapon still had great field performance. About 8,000 were built from 1944 to 1945."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4:0 "Type 4 Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "Type 4"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Type 4 Rifle was a Japanese response to semi-automatic rifle development in other countries. Rather than designing one from scratch, they elected to copy the M1 Garand, which they were coming into frequent contact with on the Pacfic Theater. The Type 4 was a reversed engineered copy of the M1 Garand, which had an internal magazine as opposed to an en-bloc clip. The rifle was supposed to begin mass production in 1945, but only 100 of a 250-gun order were completed before the war ended."

Das Design basierte auf dem der Britischen Shakespeare-Klasse Zerstörer, der einzige Unterschied bestand aus dem modernisiertem Design der Turbinen. Die Geschütze kamen von Bofor und die Feuerleitanlage von Siemens. Rumänien wollte zwei weitere in Auftrag geben aber wirtschaftliche Schwierigkeiten verhinderten weitere Anschaffungen."

Mit Ausbruch des 2. Weltkriegs in 1939 veränderten sich die Prioritäten und man war mehr interessiert in Panzer, Artillerie oder Flugzeuge welche viel schneller als Schiffe produziert werden konnten und so wurde das Projekt schlussendlich aufgegeben."

The aircraft had unequal-span sesquiplane wings and fixed tailwheel landing gear and was powered by a 470 kW (630 hp) BMW VI engine. After 180 aircraft were built, production continued with a structurally strengthened and more powerful Type 92 Model 2.

The design was in response to a requirement issued by the Imperial Japanese Army for a new fighter, and was the winner of a competition against Nakajima's Ki-11. Although the low-wing monoplane offered by Nakajima was more advanced, the Army preferred the more maneuverable biplane offered by Kawasaki. In order to overcome the speed disadvantage the Kawasaki team used a metal three-blade propeller in the third prototype, while flush-head rivets were used in an attempt to reduce drag. The structure was of all-metal construction, which was then fabric-covered. Armament consisted of two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns, synchronized to fire through the propeller. The initial production version was powered by a liquid-cooled 633 kW (850 hp) Kawasaki Ha9-IIa V-12. About 300 of the initial production version were made from December 1935 to October 1937, and another 280 of a second variant, the Ki-10-II, were built from June 1937 to December 1938."

The tank weighed 7.4 tons, and had a one-man turret fitted with a 37mm gun and two 7.7mm machine guns. The suspension system was relatively poor and did not perform excellently on rough ground, but it had fantastic mobility otherwise, and was a very effective tank in situations with less roads available. It was one of the best early war light tanks, if not the best. About 2,300 units were produced from 1936 to 1943."

It was designed to specifically fight enemy tanks, as opposed to infantry, and was equipped with up to 20mm of welded armor, and a high-velocity 47mm gun, with a top speed of 50 kph. Owing to the IJN's greater material needs, only one prototype was constructed before 1945."

It was built on a Type 95 Ha-Go tankette chassis, and intended to be similar to the German 'Marder', in that it would be sleek and small. The gun was am improved high-velocity 47mm gun, which could penetrate 50mm of armor at 500m. One prototype was made in 1945, but the war ended before serial production could begin."

It was intended primarily to support amphibious invasions, and to be used in special operations missions. It was based on the army's Type 95 Ha-Go tank, but had an all-welded hull with rubber seals, rather than riveted armor. Pontoons were attached to the front glacis and rear decking. It was fitted with a high-velocity 37mm gun and two 7.7mm machine guns. It had a max speed of 37 kph on land, and 10 kph while in the water. Generally, it is considered to be the best designed amphibious tank of the war. 184 were produced from 1942 to 1945."

It was also capable of being submarine-launched, allowing it to reinforce island garrisons during the daytime without taking heavy casualties.

They were intended to be launched from a submarine and help support troops on land. Interestingly, the Japanese instead chose to attempt to use these to torpedo American battleships at port, but the Type 4 was not suited for this task. 49 were built in 1944."

The front hull mounted a Type 1 47mm tank gun and a Type 97 7.7mm machine gun.

japanese_medium_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Type 1 Chi-He was an improved version of the the Type 97 Chi-Ha designed to counter the M4 Sherman, which could both penetrate the Type 97's armor and shrug off shots from it. The Type 1 Chi-He was equipped with a 47mm tank gun, which had improved piercing over the low-velocity 57mm gun. It had an additional 70 hp on its engine, which compensated for improved frontal armor. It was also the first Japanese tank to carry radio as standard equipment. 170 were built from 1943 to 1944."

japanese_medium_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The Type 3 Chi-Nu was developed as a stopgap between the Type 97 and the Type 4 Chi-To, as a tank was urgently needed to counter the M4 Sherman. The Type 3 was designed from May to October 1943, but was not put into production until 1944, owing to the low priority of Japanese tanks. It had a 75mm gun, 50mm of frontal sloped armor, and a 240 hp engine that enabled a top speed of 39 kph. 166 were built from 1944 to 1945."

It was a 30-ton, all-welded armor tank with a maximum armor thickness of 75mm. Its main armament was a turret mounted 75mm gun, and also had two heavy machine guns for close defense. Its 400 hp engine was considerably better than the Type 3 Chi-Nu's, giving it a top speed of 45 kph. While it was intended to produce 25 tanks per month, due to resource shortages only 6 chassis and 2 completed tanks were ever built in 1944."

japanese_medium_tank_equipment_7_desc:0 "The Type 5 Chi-Ri was the final medium tank design of the IJA during the war. Based on information gained from fighting on the Eastern Front, the Army requested a new tank which weighed 35 tons, had 75mm armor, and a 75mm gun. The IJA also wanted a tank which could consistently inflict high loss rates on the American M4 Sherman. This project became the Type 5 Chi-Ri. While the tank was quite advanced, only one unfinished prototype was ever made due to the war ending."

A 150mm mortar was mounted on a modified Type 97 Chi-Ha chassis, and could fire a 36 kg shell up to 6 kilometers. The gun crew was unprotected to the sides and the rear and the Ho-Ro had no secondary armament, making it extremely vulnerable to close combat. 12 units were produced in 1944, and rushed into combat service."

japanese_medium_tank_art_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Type 4 Ha-To was a mobile fire support platform developed in late 1943, using a 300mm heavy mortar on a modified Type 4 Chi-To medium tank chassis. The mortar had a 3 kilometer range and a 170 kg projectile. The gun was extremely heavy and could not be elevated more than 50 degrees due to balance of the vehicle. The design was well-received but it would have been expensive to produce, and so attention instead went to self-propelled multiple rocket launchers instead. 4 units were built in 1944, but none were used in combat."

It was developed by using the Type 97 Chi-Ha engine and chassis, and replacing the 57mm tank gun with a 75mm artillery piece. This gun was mounted in an open casemate, with only frontal and side armor. Due to its open design and lack of machine guns, it was quite vulnerable in close combat. 26 were built in 1942, before it was superceded by the Ho-Ni II and III."

The Type 3 Ho-Ni III, on the other hand, used an improved 75mm gun, had a fully enclosed superstructure, and up to 25mm of welded armor. It had a top speed of around 38 kph. An order of 57 was placed with Hitachi in 1944, but production was hampered by material shortages and only 41 of the order were built by the end of the war."

It had a specially designed 70mm gun, with secondary turret armament of a 37mm gun and several 6.5mm machine guns. It weighed 26 tons and had only a single inline 6-cylinder engine produced 290 horsepower - its top speed was an anemic 22 kph. It had welded armor of up to 35 mm in thickness. Ultimately, the design was too complicated, very slow, and unreliable, and only 4 prototypes were built, all in 1934. The chassis did see use in other SPG designs later in the war."

 NEW_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 NEW_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 NEW_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 NEW_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 NEW_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 NEW_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 NEW_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 NEW_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 NEW_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 NEW_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NEW_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 NEW_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 NEW_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 NEW_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 NEW_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 NEW_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 NEW_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 NEW_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 NEW_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 NEW_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 NEW_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 NEW_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 NEW_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 NEW_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 NEW_battleship_1:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 NEW_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 NEW_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 NEW_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 NEW_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 NEW_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 NEW_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 NEW_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 NEW_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 NEW_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 NEW_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 NEW_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NEW_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 NEW_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 NEW_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 NEW_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NEW_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 NEW_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 NEW_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 NEW_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
