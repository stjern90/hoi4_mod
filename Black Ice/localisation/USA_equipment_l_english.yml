 USA_carrier_2c:0 "Wasp Class CV IIc"
 USA_carrier_2c_desc:0 "The USS Wasp (CV-7) was a United States Navy aircraft carrier commissioned in 1940. As a reduced-size version of the Yorktown-class aircraft carrier hull, Wasp was more vulnerable than other United States aircraft carriers available at the opening of hostilities. The Wasp was launched with almost no armor, modest speed and a smaller aircraft group."
 USA_carrier_3:0 "Essex Class CV III"
 USA_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large compliment of planes into battle.

 USA_ecarrier_3_desc:0 "The Sangamon class were a group of four escort aircraft carriers of the United States Navy. These ships were originally Cimarron class oilers, launched in 1939 for civilian use. These ships were the largest escort carrier conversions built for the U.S. Navy and could carry 30 aircraft. The late-war Commencement Bay class escort carriers were about as large, but were built as carriers from keel up."
 USA_ecarrier_4:0 "Casablanca Class CVE IV"
 USA_ecarrier_4_desc:0 "The Casablanca-class escort carriers are the most numerous class of aircraft carriers ever built. Fifty were laid down, launched and commissioned within the space of less than two years – 3 November 1942 through to 8 July 1944. These were nearly one third of the 151 carriers built in the United States during the war. It had a larger and more useful hangar deck than previous conversions. It also had a larger flight deck than the Bogue class. Unlike larger carriers which had extensive armor, protection was limited to splinter plating and therefore the carrier design was very vulnerable."
 USA_ecarrier_5:0 "Commencement Bay Class CVE V"
 USA_ecarrier_5_desc:0 "The Commencement Bay-class escort aircraft carriers were based on the Maritime Commission type T3 Tanker hull, which gave them a displacement of approximately 23,000 tons and a length of 557 feet (170 m). The Commencement Bays were built as carriers from the keel up and 21 units were completed. Their general layout was similar to the Sangamon-class escort carriers, but some of the Sangamon's engineering shortcomings were addressed."

 USA_seaplane_tender_1_desc:0 "The USS Langley was a former aircraft carrier and on 25 October 1936, she was put into Mare Island Navy Yard, California for overhaul and conversion to a seaplane tender.  She was assigned to the Aircraft Scouting Force and commenced her tending operations out of Seattle, Washington, Sitka, Alaska, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego, California. She carried in summary 6 seaplanes and was the very first design of a decent seaplane tender."
 USA_seaplane_tender_2:0 "Curtiss Class AV"
 USA_seaplane_tender_2_desc:0 "The Curtiss class was a seaplane tender class of the United States Navy. The first ship was launched on 20 April 1940 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey. They were the first modern purpose-built seaplane tenders of USN. According to the project, each of them should maintain basing of two seaplanes squadrons and provide small repair of aircraft. The class could carry up to 30 seaplanes for reconnaissance and support duties for the Navy. Handling of seaplanes from water was realised by three powerful cranes."
 USA_seaplane_tender_3:0 "Barnegat Class AV"
 USA_seaplane_tender_3_desc:0 "The Barnegat class was a large class of United States Navy small seaplane tenders built during World War II. Before World War II, the United States Navy foresaw a need for a large force of seaplane tenders in the event of a war in the Pacific, to allow air operations from undeveloped islands and atolls. Full-size seaplane tenders (AVs) were designed to support two squadrons of flying boats each, but they were more expensive to build and had a deep draft, precluding their use in shallow harbors. The U.S. Navy therefore also planned for "small seaplane tenders" (AVPs), with a shallower draft, capable of supporting only one squadron each, but cheaper to build and able to operate in shallow waters."
 USA_seaplane_tender_4:0 "Tangier Class AV"
 USA_seaplane_tender_4_desc:0 "The second USS Tangier (AV-8) was a cargo ship, converted to a seaplane tender in the United States Navy during World War II. Constructed in 1939, the vessel was acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1940. The Tangier class featured a slow speed of 16.5 knots and could carry and maintain up to 24 seaplanes. More than 1000 men served on a ship of nearly 13.500 long tons displacement."
 USA_seaplane_tender_5:0 "Chandeleur Class AV"
 USA_seaplane_tender_5_desc:0 " In 1941 Navy has ordered some more seaplane tenders in hulls of standard transports of C3-S type. They were purchased by Navy already after launching and converted while outfitted afloat. The Chandeleur was similar to the Tangier class and could carry the same amount of seaplanes, though her design and structure was improved making her slightly more robust."
 USA_seaplane_tender_6:0 "Currituck Class AV"
 USA_seaplane_tender_6_desc:0 "The Currituck-class seaplane tenders were four ships built for the United States Navy during World War II. The role of a seaplane tender was to provide base facilities for squadrons of seaplanes in a similar way that an aircraft carrier does for its squadrons. The class featured a relative good speed of 18 knots and heavy anti aircraft armament. The Currituck class could carry and maintain up to 30 seaplanes, the latest wartime experience were incorporated in this class making it one of the best seaplane tender classes during that time."
 USA_seaplane_tender_7:0 "Kenneth Whiting Class AV"
 USA_seaplane_tender_7_desc:0 "The Kenneth Whiting class was the last class of seaplane tenders towards the end of World War II ordered by the US Navy. Her design was similar to the one of Tangier and Chandeleur class seaplane tenders, featuring as well 24 seaplanes with crane and catapult facilities, though structual improvements to the ship was incorporated. The class carried some 127mm dural purpose guns and heavy anti-aircraft armament combined with a rather slow top speed of 16.5 knots."
 USA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Montana Class SBB I"
 USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."

 usn_patrol_submarine_3_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."

 usn_patrol_submarine_4_desc:0 "V-1 through V-3 boats. The first three V-boats were funded in fiscal year 1919, laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in October and November 1921, and commissioned somewhat less than a year apart between 1924 and 1926. Significantly, V-1, V-2, and V-3 were the only members of the class designed to satisfy the Navy's original "fleet boat" requirement for high surface speed. These were large and powerfully engined submarines, displacing 2,119 long tons (2,153 t) surfaced and 2,506 long tons (2,546 t) submerged on a length of 342 ft (104 m). They were armed with six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, four forward and two aft with 12 torpedoes, plus a 5 inch (127 mm)/51 caliber deck gun."

 usn_patrol_submarine_5_desc:0 "V-4 boat only. Displacing 4,164 long tons (4,231 t) submerged, V-4—later USS Argonaut (SM-1)—was both the largest submarine the Navy ever built before the advent of nuclear power and the only U.S. submarine specifically designed as a minelayer. Her configuration, and that of the following V-5 and V-6, resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, suggested the need for long-range submarine "cruisers", or "strategic scouts", as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important."

 usn_patrol_submarine_6_desc:0 "V-5 and V-6 boats. In their overall appearance and dimensions, V-5, later Narwhal and V-6, later Nautilus were similar to Argonaut and constituted "submarine cruiser" counterparts at least partially inspired by German success with long-range submarine commerce raiders of the Type U-139 and Type U-151 U-boat classes in World War I. Endurance, sea-keeping, increased torpedo capacity, and large deck guns were emphasized at the cost of high speed. In addition to the customary torpedo tubes—four forward and two aft with 24 torpedoes (eight external) —they (and Argonaut) carried two 6 inch (152 mm)/53 caliber deck guns, the largest ever mounted on U.S. submarines."
 usn_patrol_submarine_7:0 "Dolphin Class"
 usn_patrol_submarine_7_desc:0 "V-7 boat only. The penultimate design in the V-boat series was laid down at Portsmouth in June 1930 and emerged as Dolphin (formerly V-7) two years later. With a length of 319 ft (97 m) and a displacement only a little more than half that of her three predecessors (1,718 long tons (1,746 t) surfaced, 2,240 long tons (2,280 t) submerged), Dolphin was clearly an attempt to strike a happy medium between those latter ships and earlier S-class submarines, which were little more than large coastal boats. The torpedo armament was six 21 inch (533 mm) tubes (4 bow, 2 stern), with 18 torpedoes. A 4 inch (102 mm)/50 caliber deck gun was equipped."

The Cachalot-class submarines were a pair of medium-sized submarines of the United States Navy built under the tonnage limits of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. They were originally named V-8 and V-9, and so were known as "V-boats" even though they were unrelated to the other seven submarines. The armament was similar to Dolphin: six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern), with 16 torpedoes. A 3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber deck gun was equipped, a decrease in gun caliber that would persist through early World War II. In the 1930s it was felt that a larger gun would encourage submarine captains to fight on the surface against superior anti-submarine ships, but eventually war experience showed that a larger gun was needed."

An incremental improvement over the previous Porpoise class, they were the first US submarine class to achieve 21 knots with a reliable propulsion plant, allowing them to operate with the Standard-type battleships of the surface fleet. Also, their 11,000 nautical miles (20,000 km) unrefueled range would allow them to operate in Japanese home waters."

Similar to the previous Salmon class, they were built between 1937 and 1939. With a top speed of 21 knots, a range of 11,000 nautical miles (20,000 km) (allowing patrols in Japanese home waters), and a reliable propulsion plant, along with the Salmons they were an important step in the development of a true fleet submarine.

The two submarines were similar in size and capability to the S-class submarines built at the end of World War I, and had been ordered to test the feasibility of using mass production techniques to build small submarines. Until at least 1940 it was thought that mass production of fleet submarines would be impractical, and in any case small submarines could provide area defense for submarine bases."
 usn_patrol_submarine_15:0 "Gato Class"
 usn_patrol_submarine_15_desc:0 "The Gato class were a class of submarines built for the United States Navy and launched in 1941–1943; they were the first mass-production U.S. submarine class of World War II. Together with their near-sisters the Balao and Tench classes, their design formed the majority of the United States Navy's World War II submarine fleet. Named after the lead ship of the class, USS Gato, the Gatos and their successors formed the core of the submarine service that was largely responsible for the destruction of the Japanese merchant marine and a large portion of the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II. Gato's name comes from a species of small catshark."

They originally had the hull classification symbol SSK, for "hunter-killer submarine". It was known that the Soviet Navy had acquired the German Type XXI U-boat and other advanced submarines, and was expected to rapidly put derivatives of them into production.
