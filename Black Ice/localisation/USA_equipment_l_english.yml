 USA_submarine_1:0 "S Class"
 USA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."
