 NZL_workshop_production_desc:0 "British weapons are in short supply as the UK rearms. An engineer by the name of Philip Charlton has developed a kit to convert Boer War-era rifles into light machine guns. Historically 1500 were built. Although considered inferior to a new-built Bren, it was available, lighter and worked perfectly and reliably during testing."
 NZL_truck_assembly_plant:0 "Truck Assembly Plants"

 NZL_armor_effort:0 "Local Production"
 NZL_armor_effort_desc:0 "We can develop our subcontracting further, producing and assemblying components for armoured cars and other light armoured vehicles, both licensed and home-designed. Historically 1300 tracked carriers, and other vehicles, were produced. The General Motors plant in Wellington was the most notable factory involved."
 NZL_armor_effort2:0 "Domestic Designs"
 NZL_armor_effort2_desc:0 "With foreign sales cut off, a number of citizens have proposed basic light tank designs we can construct ourselves.

 NZL_radio_industry:0 "Radio Industry"
 NZL_radio_industry_desc:0 "Our fledgling radio industry is expanding rapidly to cope with our own needs. We can expand further to export additional radios and even radar units to our allies."
 # Singapore
 NZL_singapore_focus:0 "The Singapore Strategy"
 NZL_singapore_focus_desc:0 "From the 1920's our core defence policy has been to rely on Royal Navy assistance, sustained by a fortified naval base. It's status as a symbol of Imperial commitment helped obscure the growing strategic weaknesses in the strategy. Historically New Zealand helped fund the Naval base, which was finished in 1939."
 NZL_singapore_forts:0 "Contribute to Landward Forts"
 NZL_singapore_forts_desc:0 "For better or for worse, work on the grandly-named 'Fortress Singapore' goes slowly. The Singapore Strategy as written requires Australasia to hold on until the Royal Navy can arrive. Contributing to defence works is an option we can choose. Historically the UK started work on ground fortifications, unfinished when invasion occurred."
 # Naval Tree
 NZL_naval_effort:0 "Develop Shipbuilding"
 NZL_naval_effort_desc:0 "Our country has an established, if modest, shipbuilding industry. Historically, shipyard expansion for repairs and the construction of minesweepers and smaller craft occurred from 1940. However, our citizens and policies support industrialisation, and we can focus on shipbuilding now if we so choose." 
 NZL_navy_doctrine:0 "Our Place in the World"

 NZL_destroyer_effort2:0 "Patrol Craft"
 NZL_destroyer_effort2_desc:0 "Our waters need defenders. We can start planning for the construction of smaller craft on our own initiative. Historically motor launches were constructed that saw service in the island campaigns. In total nearly 500 vessels were constructed during the war, and at least partial repairs done on over 1000 US ships."
 NZL_navy_doctrine2:0 "Form the RNZN"
 NZL_navy_doctrine2_desc:0 "As the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, due to expansion our forces are largely self-sufficient and independent of the Royal Navy. Identifying our navy as our own recognises this fact. Historically this occurred 1 October 1941."
 NZL_cruiser_effort:0 "British Cruiser Designs"
 NZL_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers have long patrolled the South Pacific, being a versatile and balanced ship with adequate range. Perhaps it is time we constructed our own."
 NZL_submarine_effort:0 "British Submarine Designs"
 NZL_submarine_effort_desc:0 "While they may lack for versatility and persistance, submarines make up for it with cost-effectiveness. We can investigate taking a more offensive approach to the control of our shipping lanes."
 NZL_us_programme:0 "United States Programme"
 NZL_us_programme_desc:0 "The United States has enquired whether our country can construct smaller craft such as tow boats, tugs and powered lighters for the Pacific. We have no steel-workers not already engaged on essential work. However, we can rapidly retrain and supervise carpenters and other trainees, use coachbuilding firms, and bring in steel-workers from the Railway Workshops. Historically over 100 vessels were built."
 # Island Defence
 NZL_fiji_focus:0 "Defence of the Local Islands"
 NZL_fiji_focus_desc:0 "Our means may be limited, but we can still look to our own defence. To the west lies the bulwark of Australia. The most direct threat to our trade and freedom will come from the north. We can build a base in Fiji to help protect our coastal waters."
 NZL_fiji_focus2:0 "Reinforce Fiji"
 NZL_fiji_focus2_desc:0 "We can further develop the installations in our northern neighbour."
 # Look Outside the Commonwealth

 NZL_technology_sharing_desc:0 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime R&D more efficiently."
 NZL_political_effort:0 "Look Beyond the Commonwealth"
 NZL_political_effort_desc:0 "New powers are arising in the Pacific, and Britain is occupied ever-more distantly in Europe. While our ties to Britain may remain, our country's needs may require us to look at other options as well. Historically this occurred during the close cooperation with the US needed during the Pacific campaign, and the reality of a US-dominated Pacific after the end of the war."
