The meeting marked a turning point in Hitler's foreign policies which then began to radicalize.  It outlined Hitler's plans for expansion in Europe.\n\nAccording to the Memorandum, Hitler did not want war in 1939 with Britain and France.  What he wanted was small wars of plunder to help support Germany's struggling economy.  Although the Nazis never let on about their financial problems.  Hitler wanted a full-scale European war with Britain and France between 1941-1944/45."

 news.2242.d:0 "The Blomberg-Fritsch Affair were two related scandals in early 1938 that resulted in the subjugation of the German Armed Forces by Hitler.  The affair started after the 12 January 1938 marriage of War Minister Werner von Blomberg when a policeman reported that his young bride had previously posed for pornographic photos.  Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage in order to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army.  Blomberg refused to annul the marriage and when Goering threatened to make his wife's past public knowledge, Blomberg consequently resigned on 27 January 1938.  Goering did not want Fritsch to become the successor to Blomberg and thus his superior.  Himmler wanted to weaken the Wehrmacht in order to strengthen his Schutzstaffel as a competitor to the regular German Army.  Reinhard Heydrich had prepared a file on von Fritsch with allegations of homosexuality.  Fritsch resigned on 4 February 1938."

 news.2244.d:0 "Modern Times is a 1936 comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin in which his iconic Little Tramp character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the Great Depression, conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization.\n\nChaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first talkie, and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of the Tramp would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen."

Schmeling had studied Louis' style, and in the days before the fight, he claimed to have found the key to victory - fans thought that he was just trying to raise interest in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion.\n\nAs rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling's jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible.\n\nBy round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis' only knockout defeat during his prime."

The term eventually became the standard designation for all intelligence from high-level cryptanalytic sources.  The name arose because the code-breaking was considered more important than the highest security classification available at the time, (Most Secret), and so was regarded as being Ultra secret.  Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, hence the term Ultra has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts".  The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is credited with having provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort and with having shortened the war, though Ultra's precise influence is still being studied and debated.

The British used this information as the foundation for their own early efforts to decrypt Enigma.  The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire "shooting party" was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages. These proved too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections."

Across Canada, 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots.

It was created to consolidate the many small camps that had been set up by various police agencies and the NSDAP to house political prisoners. The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later concentration camps. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the concentration camps under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the "Death's Head Units", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major concentration camps. Leadership at the camps was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional camps.[92] Six concentration camps[a] housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939. By the end of the war, hundreds of camps of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people, most of whom were targeted by the regime because of their race. The concentration camp population rose in tandem with the defeats suffered by the Nazi regime; the worse the catastrophe seemed, the greater the fear of subversion, prompting the SS to intensify their repression and terror."

The SS-VT had to depend on the German Army for its supply of weapons and military training, and they had control of the recruiting system through local draft boards responsible for assigning conscripts to the different branches of the Wehrmacht to meet quotas set by the German High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or OKW in German).

By 1938 the height restrictions were relaxed, up to six dental fillings were permitted, and eyeglasses for astigmatism and mild vision correction were allowed. Once World War II in Europe commenced, the physical requirements were no longer strictly enforced, and essentially any recruit who could pass a basic medical exam was considered for Waffen-SS service. Following the campaign in the West in 1940, Hitler authorized the enlistment of "people perceived to be of related stock", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks. A number of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns volunteered to fight in the Waffen-SS under the command of German officers.

 engpolitical.1.t:0 "National Registration Act of 1939"
 engpolitical.1.d:0 "The National Registration Act 1939 was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. The initial National Registration Bill was introduced to Parliament as an emergency measure at the start of World War II. Royal assent given on 5 September 1939.\n\nThe Act established a National Register which began operating on 29 September 1939 (National Registration Day), a system of identity cards, and a requirement that they must be produced on demand or presented to a police station within 48 hours.\n\nThree main reasons for their introduction:\n\n1. The major dislocation of the population caused by mobilisation and mass evacuation and also the wartime need for complete manpower control and planning in order to maximise the efficiency of the war economy.\n\n2. The likelihood of rationing (introduced from January 1940 onwards).\n\n3. Population statistics. As the last census had been held in 1931, there was little accurate data on which to base vital planning decisions. The National Register was in fact an instant census and the National Registration Act closely resembles the 1920 Census Act in many ways."
